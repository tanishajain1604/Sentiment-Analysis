    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

       "[['Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might nee',\n",
       "  'd this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his f',\n",
       "  'amily would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman ',\n",
       "  'is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it ba',\n",
       "  \"ckfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when\",\n",
       "  ' he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walki',\n",
       "  'ng. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their ',\n",
       "  \"in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine \",\n",
       "  'by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy doub',\n",
       "  'le standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

       " ['Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you',\n",
       "  \"? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. Yeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” \",\n",
       "  'And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventual',\n",
       "  'ly got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.” I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the w',\n",
       "  'oods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. I’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny. I think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind wo',\n",
       "  'uld ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.” My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some mo',\n",
       "  'ney like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.” Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I',\n",
       "  ' went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tr',\n",
       "  'agedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?” No. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fu',\n",
       "  \"ck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.” This might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material.

       " ['Beth Stelling’s stand-up comedy special, “Girl Daddy,” was released on HBO Max on August 20, 2020. The show was recorded at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Beth Stelling is a comedian who has been in the industry for over a decade. Her comedy style is known for being artfully hilarious and thought-provoking. In “Girl Daddy,” Stelling talks about her family, society, and the exes who have shaped her. She shares her experiences with sex, drugs, and babies in a way that is both relatable and entertaining. In this special, Stelling talks about how she has been called a “female comic” so many times that if she ever has kids, they might as well call her “girl daddy”. She also shares her thoughts on the societal expectations placed on women and how she has navigated them throughout her life. * * * ♪ So I started to speak freely ♪ ♪ Figured it would lead me to war or a peace treaty ♪ ♪ And knew no matter what, end up with a deep sleep ♪ ♪ And the habits of a soul who knows what it’s seeking ♪ ♪ You’re thinking it’s a joke, but it’s not folks ♪ ♪ It’s all in the delivery ♪ Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you for coming out. It is good to be here in Minneapolis, thank you. Whenever I’m on tour, I have to prepare to be gone for awhile. And so I was at the pharmacy, I was picking up my prescription for acne. I love my acne, keeps me young. I’m on antibiotics, they’re working. I’ve been on them for seven years, which I heard is good for you. Before that, I was on spironolactone, any spiro heads here? Are you really on it? Did it make you pee a lot? Yes, and it made me faint. What? Did it thin your hair at all? No. Okay, we can, we’ll talk more later. It did, it made me pee a lot, it thinned my hair out, it made my boobs hurt really bad. I grew very alarmed and I chose to do nothing. I just waited for the follow-up appointment with the doctor and he said, “Oh yeah, I should have told you, “it’s going to make your boobs,” he actually said titties, he was like, “It’s going to make your titties more sensitive.” I thought, that would have been nice to know. I’ve been slowly saying goodbye to my family. So I’m at the pharmacy, you can’t help, but pick up other things, they designed it that way. And Easter is my favorite season of candy. Now, thankfully they have Peeps pretty much year-round. So I picked up some, who knows, Flag Day peeps. I don’t look at the shape before, I barely taste when I eat. And I also picked up a bunch of condoms ’cause I’m the breadwinner of most of my relationships. And I’m also not on birth control because sometimes birth control is like, I know you’re hungry, but what if you cried? So I don’t do that. And as I’m checking out the man at the pharmacy, he slides my prescription and I sign for it. He slides the Peeps and then he goes to slide the condoms and for some reason out loud to him, I say, “These aren’t for me.” I’m a grown woman in my sixties, like I’m very open about sex, all of a sudden a man, I don’t know, touches a box of condoms, and I’m like these, I would never, I got back to my car and I turned inward. I was like, what happened back there, man? You got weird. I don’t know, I guess if you’re a dude buying condoms, maybe you feel cool. ‘Cause like you’re gonna get laid or whatever. I don’t know how you feel. Do you, or, he’s like I don’t wear condoms, because I don’t get pregnant. That always cracks me up, wen the dude chimes in with like, she trapped me with a baby. Impossible. You have the missing ingredient and we love to bake. if I had all the ingredients for a cake except for the sugar, and then you, what’s your name? Jeremy. Jeremy brought over the sugar, we’d be like this cake wouldn’t be possible without Jeremy. thank you so much for this cake, Jeremy. Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy. That’s right. What I’m saying is men are garbage, but But, women are the can, okay. So we’re in it together. Sometimes you have to flip us over and shake us for us to let go of garbage. But I think what it boils down to in my personal opinion, I think dudes, you’re just, you’re more in touch with your personal pleasure from a very early age. Late elementary, early junior high, the boys I grew up with in Ohio were just constantly talking about jerking off or jerking off or doing this motion, which I added to my vocabulary far too soon. I had no clue what it meant. I would just be like, okay, mom, take a gamble. I was puni',\n",
       "  'shed. It’s so high. What are we doing with it up here? Everybody knows, it’s like… vi-vi-vi-vi… Like who are you jerking off that’s shoulder height. That’s question one from me. Then sex ed happened in junior high. I remember our health teacher saying I taught my sons how to masturbate. I was like, is that legal? I thought we were hiding it. But young girls have sex organs, too. Even though some of us don’t look down until we’re 23. But as a kid, I was secretly humping all kinds of stuff around the house. I was humping the couch, I was humping the bannister, with a pillow after this splinter incident. I was humping the edge of the bathtub. I remember one year my mom wanted to move and I said, we can’t. My girlfriends live here. Can you imagine if we taught our daughters to masturbate? My mom could’ve kept decorative pillows about, instead it took like the strength of three of my closest girlfriends when we turned 18 to even go to a sex store. Meanwhile, I feel like into adulthood, dudes, you can just hop in your car, drive somewhere, get fully jerked off. I was a little vague. In my head, I was thinking like a rub and tug scenario or a happy ending situation. You know what I’m talking about? He was like, yes, that’s how we met. Have any women here been offered a happy ending? Just an angry silence. It’s more of a man’s game, the happy ending. I guess it’s what we look at as like your complete and total relaxation, either that or we look at your semen as poison and we’re like, get it out of them so they don’t hurt anybody. I think it’s a positive thing, as long as nobody’s freaking trapped in a room. And of course whether you know it or not, there’s tons of sex workers all around us. The problem is whenever I get a massage, I just assume that the massage therapist is falling in love with me. Do you do that, I’m like we’re not talking, but I’m pretty sure he’s impressed with my back. And maybe my shoulders would drop two inches if somebody just offered to like, just a little bit. But no, for a lot of reasons, a lot of liabilities, the main one being that massage therapists are not sex workers. That’s the big one. It got conflated along the way. I don’t know why, maybe because people were already naked. I feel like if somebody started offering hand jobs at the pool, lifeguards would probably suffer the same plight. They’re just like trying to save somebody and the person’s like, yeah, choke me. And I’m like, what the fuck? I don’t think that the female orgasm is as equated with relaxation and release. I think it’s because everyone assumes women relax by like curling up on a couch at night, underneath a quilt that we made, just warming ourselves by a fire, while we pet our cat, and sip Celestial Seasonings tea like mmm, mmm, mmm. I’ve never orgasmed that way. Not once, it would take so much from the cat and its little paw. And then after an hour I’d be like, get off of me. I’ll do it myself. I have a good amount of guy friends that genuinely believe that they like sex more than women. And I love orgasming. There’s not a woman in here who doesn’t love orgasming. It’s the sex that’s the problem. Now, look, I assume every man in here tonight is just so good at fucking, so I’m not talking about anybody in here. The problem is outside and we just have to take what we talk about here tonight and help them. I try to have healthy conversations about these things. I did a podcast recently in exchange for some tap water and two new fans. The podcast, it was hosted by a male comedian and he wanted to talk about the Me Too movement because you gotta if you have a lady on the pod. And his hot take was sort of the Me Too movement, well, what are we supposed to do now? I was like, what were you doing before? I guess keep doing or stop doing that. Now we were doing shows together all weekend and I was the only comic on the shows who agreed to do his podcast. So I decided to take it as an opportunity to confront him about one of his jokes that I didn’t love and this podcast was never released . We don’t like to be challenged. But he had a joke that he was performing that went like I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows. Which is true. When a male comic’s up here, it’s very attractive to women, a sense of humor, and he has an hour window after the show to capitalize on that before the girl finds out like, oh my God, he’s so sad. So his joke was like,',\n",
       "  ' I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows. Now, if I want to fuck a chick and she likes it rough, I’m going to need paperwork to fuck. Insinuating that if she were also into rough sex, she would then later lie and use it to accuse him of, what’s it called when somebody wants to have sex with you, but you don’t, and they do it anyway? Rape. Thank you, it’s so much easier when somebody else brings it up. People do not like hearing a woman comic say that word. I guess because the dudes are like, hey, that’s our thing. I think paperwork’s a good idea. I’m for it. I am pro paperwork. Just to be clear, I think it’s interesting he decided to live in a profession that’s been relegated to women for the last hundred years like he’d probably need me to like draw up the paperwork for him. In which case, I could put a clause in there that says not bringing the female to climax is punishable by law. Or something, I don’t know, I’m spitballing. And then maybe a clause in there for him that says like the safe word is stop. Give that a whirl. It just bothered me that night after night, he was performing these jokes for crowds full of people just like you. Well, we were in Vegas, like nothing like you. Just scaring roomfuls of dudes about having post-Me Too sex, when most of you guys are doing it right. There’s probably only like one rapist in here. I don’t know, maybe two, look around, they’re not laughing. Are you sitting here as a heterosexual man, and you don’t know how to touch a woman, like get up here. I’ll show you, I’m just kidding. I feel like, do you know how to pet a cat? How about that? If you’re scared during these times and you’re alone with a woman, just pretend that it’s a cat. That’s my advice for you. Just wait for it to come up to you. It might take a while. Let it smell you before you pet it. And if it’s all curled up sleeping, don’t pick it up. It doesn’t like that. And then if the cat comes up to you and starts rubbing its face on your face, hard, sometimes shockingly hard, then you can ask yourself, like, is this cat trying to fuck? And then yes, go ahead and fuck that cat. You guys seem cool. Maybe I was wrong and I was just overly worried for you guys. I just didn’t like that he would be scaring you, but maybe you’re not scared at all, and it’s just like a handful of celebrities and some very vocal comics that are scared, scared of getting accused of rape. For some reason, it’s easier to hear in a Scottish accent. I don’t know, I don’t know why they’re scared. They’re going to get away with it. If they go through this system is what I’m saying. I was watching a famous colleague of mine yell into a microphone and he was like, so you know there’s no due process, it’s fricking crazy. A woman makes a claim and people just believe her without going through the legal system. I’m like, ah, the legal system, or as I like to call it, the white man’s FUBU… just For Us By Us. It’s their safe space really. It’s why they have a checklist of things they like you to go down after you’ve been raped. Number one: did you go to the cops? It’s like me personally, I would rather talk to Ice T’s character of a cop than a real cop if I got raped, because at least Ice T would listen and then say something like, that’s messed up. And then when he got back to the precinct, he’d probably fire something off like gotta be Mrs. Butterworth in order to make a rape charge stick. Two: they’re always like, did you go to the hospital? It’s like, do you guys remember at the beginning, when I thought I had breast cancer and I just waited it out. If I got raped, I don’t want to run an errand, okay. And three: they really don’t want you to use social media about it, ’cause then other people might come forward and something might get done. So they sort of villainize you and call you like a social justice or a hashtag warrior. And it’s like, do you guys think that Tarana Burke wanted to start the Me Too movement on Twitter? The same website people use to talk about their Taco Bell diarrhea? I’m thinking no, but her options were limited. And then there will always be somebody who says, women make these claims for attention. And I’m just like, who would want that attention? Like, what are the benefits? Are you imagining these women going to job interviews and saying things like, as you can see on my resume, not only have I been raped, I’ve also been doxed. And I th',\n",
       "  'ink you’ll find that I work best in groups rather than one-on-one. And I’m willing to work 24-7 because frankly, I’m terrified to be alone in my apartment. And that’s just a job interview for Taco Bell. So you can imagine, I just, I can’t think of like a celebrity accuser. The only one that comes to mind, I guess, is Lorena Bobbitt, but she didn’t do that for attention. She just got famous for disarming her assailant. I don’t know, maybe arm is generous. Still, if I could choose a superpower, it would be penis 100%. I’m so jealous of your dicks. I want one to have and to hold, but like also on my person, I feel like it’s easier to pee. You can pee anywhere, shape, line, you can spell your name, Jeremy. Is it a Y there at the end? Really let her rip. I also think it’s easier to receive pleasure from a stranger. Like anybody can figure it out. It’s like up down. I think it’s cause your penises are outside of you. Right, you know what I mean. He’s like my dick is out right now. But for me, more of an indoor situation, our bodies are like homes. Some of us more an Airbnb, but we can be, we can be entered. We can be entered. That’s why it’s important to knock or bring a gift. Just because you’ve come over once doesn’t mean you get keys, crazy. But dudes, you have like a fun, quick name for pleasure on the go, it’s blowjob. And then sometimes you shorten that to BJ or like beej. But for me it’s like, can I interest you in performing cunnilingus? It sounds scientific. Even our fun word for it, going down, has a negative connotation. It’s like going down to hell. It’s a little hot down there, but hypothetically, any person in here with a penis could just walk back to the bathrooms, get a quick beej to compleesh, but me, I have to walk back to the bathrooms, make sure that there’s a koala care station. Pull it down. Hoist my body up onto it. Get these overalls off. Buckle myself in, in case it’s good. And then fingers crossed that I showered. No, but truly like if you had a long day at work and then you found out you were going to get intimate with somebody and you didn’t feel fresh, you could just slip away to the bathroom and wash your dick off in the sink. And I hope you do. But for me it’s like, have you ever tried to gut a pumpkin? There’s a lot of seeds. Is my hand better or a spoon? We can’t be sure it’s clean until we get a candle in here. You’re not going to find me pants-less on the Koala Care. I promise. Frankly, it won’t hold me. I’m definitely more of a relationship person. Like I’m willing to be unhappy with someone for up to three years. I’ve also never been dumped, I’m undefeated. Thank you, oh thank you so much. I tend to go relationship to relationship. I think a professional would call that codependent. I call it college educated, okay. I don’t quit a job before I have another one lined up. My last relationship was very on again, off again. I would break up with him, but it wouldn’t stick. He would convince me that we were soulmates and then later complained you’re always trying to change me. I’m like, yes, exactly. You won’t let me go, I’m making do with what I have. He did have a big penis, he wanted me to tell you guys that. I’m sure he still has it. Everybody acts like that’s a good thing. It always gave me anxiety, especially before sex. I always felt like I was prepping myself for minor outpatient surgery. Just in the way that he’d always say, now you’re going to feel a little bit of light pressure. And then it was over. He’d be like count back from 100, I never got into the eighties. And then afterwards he’d be standing over me like you lost a lot of fluid. I’m like, that was you. He would always go down on me, which you should all be doing, before sex, but he would just go down on me and then he would drool a lot all over my hoot and then look up and say, whoa, you’re so wet. That would be like if I lit the kitchen on fire and then yelled, dinner’s ready. You cannot unlock a lock by just dousing it in WD-40. There’s a key. Sometimes there’s a code. I’m not saying I’m amazing in bed. Like sure, I’ve gotten my 10,000 hours in and I hate to brag, but I can last forever in bed without coming. Hours, weeks, I’ve gone a year. I didn’t even have to think about dead animals or baseball, like I was trying. So I’ve turned to dating younger men, I’m a bit of a coug. Thank you. I like sleeping with younger men because you can use ',\n",
       "  'tactics on them in bed that you know work on younger people. For example, you can be like, let’s see how fast you can do it, I’ll time you. Last one to come’s a rotten egg. I’m kidding, it’s me. All my eggs are rotten, I’m 63. I’ve been dating a guy who’s nine years younger than me. And, when we first started dating, I had like high school feelings for him. And I couldn’t tell whether it was ’cause he was the one or just so recently out of high school. He’s of age, to be clear. I don’t want to creep anybody out. I feel like I’m teaching him a lot about life, love, sober sex. I’m raising a wonderful young man. And he’s teaching me stuff too about memes, it’s mostly memes. I’m haha, he’s more LOL. There’s an age gap. If you are sitting here as a relationship person, you have to be careful because, you know, you end a relationship with this high level of intimacy and when you meet someone new, you have to start over. But it’s very tempting to pick up right where you left off because you can hit it off with a stranger immediately. And you can’t always tell whether it’s passion, or alcoholism, or mental illness. Sometimes it takes a bit for that to roll out. I was once dating this con artist. He would prefer artist. Three months into our relationship, I actually caught him eating one of his boogers. Now, in his defense, there was still like a little bit of cocaine left in it, but it’s a bad sign, you know, when you wish your boyfriend just ate regular boogs. This is sort of when I wish women would talk more, you know, like give each other the review. We keep very separate and that’s where their strength lies. I was warned once, she was just too late, and a woman came up to me after a show and she said, hey, we need to talk. And I thought ruh-roh. She said, I also dated that con artist after you and a little bit during. And she said, he gave me chlamydia. So you might want to go get checked. And then I went and I got checked and I didn’t have it. So I didn’t need to tell you guys any of that. I think my point was I don’t know why I was drawn to this person. Like I barely drink, I’ll have a beer. I’ll take a little toot on the weed horn, absolutely. But hard drugs scare me. Like the closest I’ve come to doing cocaine is just trying to pet a guinea pig in a cage. Have you ever done that? Oh my God, they’re in there, they’re running around, they’re kicking up chips. It’s like, what a rush. Try to get your hand in and out of there without freaking out. Your heart’s gonna race, I guarantee it. Separately, I dated a Russian DJ, naturally, and he had just told me that he was going to stop doing cocaine for me, which meant he was going to stop telling me when he did cocaine. This is one of those like hit it off immediately situations, we’re very into each other and it’s like our fourth date, but I’m trying to keep it light and not latch on too soon. And he looks at me across the table and he says, I haven’t felt this way about a woman in six years. And all I could think was just, who is she? All I need is an Instagram handle, so I can go to her Etsy store and order one of her items and leave a cryptic review I love women. I hate what we do in review sections. I do a lot of online shopping to feel whole and I order many, many items. All of which I send back and I read a ton of reviews ’cause I’m very careful when I waste my time. And I will be on bloomingdales.com, looking at some inordinately expensive T-shirt where a woman has written a review that says I’m five-foot-one, 90 pounds, and swimming in a small. It’s like we get it. You’ve never broken a chair. Just say it runs large, okay. We don’t need your stats, Nina. So after this woman called me fat on the internet, I retaliated and I wrote my own review of the same t-shirt without having purchased it. And my review, I wrote I’m five-foot-nine I graduated magna cum laude. I have a really big one bedroom and I don’t weigh myself, post. 43 people found that helpful. I don’t, I don’t weigh myself. I just ask someone to draw me. And if they reach for a jumbo Sharpie, maybe I dial it back a bit. If I feel like it, I like fluctuating. It keeps it fun, keeps it fresh. I heard it’s good for your heart. I used to weigh myself when I was chubbier, when I was working in the bagel industry. I was in quality control. And when I worked at the bagel shop, I ate too much, too many times, to the point where you cou',\n",
       "  'ld see it on my body. Food is interesting like that, you show your work. I put up some of my best numbers at the bagel shop. It was during a time in my life where I thought that cookies might go extinct. My top score was 198 pounds, which, I’m 5-9 as I mentioned, it’s kind of nothing on my frame. You know, 198 is not a wake-up call. That’s a challenge. You’re going to get two pounds away from 200 and not hit it. Go fuck yourself. I did it the next day. No matter what the scale says, I always feel good about myself. I have like reverse body dysmorphia or something. ‘Cause if you don’t know, regular body dysmorphia, it’s when you think you’re fat, but you’re actually stupid. No, there’s other reasons like mothers and being brainwashed by doctored images of other women. since the time we could see. That one’s a little dark, but I keep it in. I guess I wouldn’t have to make jokes about this stuff if women’s worth, weren’t still based on our looks but for some reason it is. Some people know that and they think the highest compliment that they can pay a woman is like, hey, I noticed that you lost weight and you look amazing. And that just fills us up because we are so hungry. And if you think about it, all you’re really saying is like, hey, I noticed that you take up less space and I like it. And we’re like, thank you. Someday, I hope to not even be here. I wish I didn’t remember every negative thing somebody said to me about my body. But it’s the stuff people say to you about your appearance that you remember. If nobody said anything, I would have been fine. Can’t see how big your ass is when you’re trucking straight ahead. I was dating a guy for a while and we went out to eat and we finished the meal. And then I decided to order a cinnamon roll to go, just to feel safe, and he looked at me and he said, I love you, but I don’t think you need that cinnamon roll. For free, nobody there to him to say it. So when we got back to my apartment, he asked, are you mad at me? And I said, yes. And he explained, I was just worried about your health. Now to give it context, he and I had had discussions about how sometimes people who’ve been through trauma have an emotional attachment to food. And that’s true for me. Sometimes being full feels like a hug from the inside. So while I appreciate his concern, I’d only gain 10 or 15 pounds and you can’t die from a muffin top. Now here’s where he tripped into a light jog out of my life. He decided to add, “It’s just that my therapist told me that I could tell you that I was more attracted to you when you were exercising and eating better.” And I thought, is your therapist your friend Sean? ‘Cause it sounds like Sean, who also called me crazy for making you wash your hands before sex after riding the subway, but I feel like every surgeon has to scrub in, okay. This was all coming from a very thin person and I never asked him to eat more so it didn’t feel like I was trying to snuggle with a jungle gym, or get fucked by a rhombus. That’s a lot of sharp angles coming at me. Whatever, everybody’s health goals are different. Some people’s health goals are just being able to tell what the diarrhea was from. I think we’re finally in a good place where everybody realizes that being fat doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy and being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy. When I was 200 pounds, I lived with a girl who was a hundred pounds and she would always call herself fat. She was a German shepherd, but like she carried it well. It affects everybody. I know it affects men too. Of course you guys aren’t immune to body image issues, or maybe you have events in mind you’d like to look good for. I remember my sister got married during my bagel years and I made the mistake of comparing myself to one of the other bridesmaids online, which you never want to do, you know it, don’t compare yourself to other people. But I remember thinking I’m going to lose so much weight for this wedding. And then, oh, I didn’t. I just kept being me and I got a last-minute spray tan instead. I just showed up to my sister’s wedding looking insane, just chubby and orange, which at the time was not presidential, okay, this is years prior. Probably started it. I remember one of the other bridesmaids in the party pulled me aside before like the aisle part, and she said, remember Beth, today is about your sister, it’s not about you. I was like, what? I can’t he',\n",
       "  'lp that I’m pulling focus, okay. I’m orange and I have a dark brown upper lip. It sticks to the fur. Thankfully they got a divorce so those photos have been destroyed. It always amazes me whenever my sister gets married. You could look at it negatively. I think it’s a beautiful thing, I do. Do you know how hard it is to put yourself out there, over and over again, and be vulnerable enough to fall in love. I’m a full coward. I’m very noncommittal. If I’m ever at the altar and the pastor says, do you, Beth, take this person to be your whatever. If so, say I do. I’m just going to be like, eh, it’s not that I don’t. I just feel weird saying it in front of everybody. Good news is I come from a very pro-divorce family and my older sister and I, we never liked our middle sister’s first husband. He had a Samsung Galaxy. But I was praying that his would explode over his penis. Is that how religion works, I just started. I may have tweeted something to that effect, and he found the tweet, which I appreciate the follow, brother. But he got very upset and he showed the tweet to my sister. And he said, your sister’s tweeting about my dick getting blown off, with like the rage of a man who plays softball. And I am going to save it and I’m going to read it to the kids to sabotage their relationship with Beth. And I was like, whoa, I can’t believe I got him to read to his kids. My sister tried everything. I don’t know if you’ve ever planned a second or third wedding, but stuff starts flying off the truck. You find yourself cutting corners, saying things like, maybe we don’t need to walk down the aisle. We could already be down there. Or who needs a reception, we’ll just meet at the bar. And the dresses change over time. Your first wedding, you’re in a beautiful ball gown. And eventually you end up in a white business suit just like, this time I’m serious. Now of course, marriage can be a beautiful thing. I’m thankful I don’t feel the pressure to do it, but I love watching my sisters do it. I don’t love all the traditions they’ve kept. Like I don’t enjoy the bride sweepstakes, the giveaway part where our dad walks ’em down the aisle in a white dress. And he’s like, here are the untouched goods, you take care of it. It just feels weird, I don’t want my dad giving me away, like he never had me. I also feel there’s gotta be somebody better suited for the job. I was thinking about it long and hard, and what I came up with was maybe my ex-boyfriend, Nick, will do it, give me away. We had three wonderful years together. I loved him, he loved me. I actually have his name tattooed on my back, so he kind of owes me on this. And I broke up with him, but he’s married now, so maybe he’d like to hear from me. I don’t know. I found out he was married because of Instagram. I still follow his sister, she hasn’t blocked me yet. And she posted this beautiful photo of him and his wife on their wedding day, which I felt like was really in my face. I think if I asked him to do it, he would. And then Nick could walk me down the aisle and we’d get to my almost-husband, and then maybe like one last kiss and then Nick could lean into him and whisper something like there’s a little bit left, you know, or something. I don’t know, I’m workshopping it. I just want somebody to make an honest woman out of me. And then if his wife hates the idea I could offer to get her name tattooed under his. It’s like his name, her name, any children they have, I’m willing to do pets. I should be arrested. I really do have his name tattooed back there. Do you know how hard it is to get laid with another man’s name on your back? Not hard, it isn’t. Never been an issue. Despite everything I’ve said leading up to this point, I do have a relationship with my father. I just called him back yesterday, ’cause he had called me on Father’s Day and I wanted to get back. My parents divorced when I was young and my dad moved down to Orlando, Florida to be an actor, which is not where you go. He did, he eventually landed a role as Blackbeard at Pirate’s Cove mini putt-putt golf course. And when you know celebrities, there are going to be perks. So my two older sisters and I, we would leave our mom in Ohio and go down to Orlando to visit our dad because it was court-ordered. Free putt-putt, baby. My dad would dress like a pirate from here down. And then Alice, the manager at the time, would give my dad this huge',\n",
       "  ' Blackbeard head to put on top of his head that rested on his shoulders. And then he would walk around the mini golf place making people’s time better, question mark. But before my dad’s shift would start and before we ran off, he would pull us aside after we picked out our clubs and he’d gather us around and he’d get very serious and he’d be like, girls, listen up, get over here. Look at me. Listen. When the head goes on, look at me. When the head goes on. I’m not dad anymore. Very method, okay, which from one artist to another, I respected, but I was also the youngest of the three girls. You know when your sisters tell you to shut up? And then two seconds later you’re like, as we go on, we remember, and then they hit you and you’re like, I’m sorry. I forgot, seriously I forgot. So I did, I forgot. And I got a little hole in one and I started yelling for my dad instead of Blackbeard. And he found where the sound was coming from in the head, he was like at a higher hole. And he peeked around this blue waterfall and just looked down at us and shook the whole head, like no. I don’t know if you’ve ever disappointed a parent that has a bigger head on top of their head, but it’s like triple the disappointment. And also a little passive-aggressive, ’cause there’s like a huge smile on the outside of the face, But not on the inside. After that, he could have gone anywhere, Disney, Universal, the mall, but he bucked industry standards and he started his own business that’s called Stars on Call. He describes his work as live roadside commercials or like character directionals. He dresses up in different costumes and he stands in front of businesses that are paying them to get people inside. I’m sure you have people like that here, right? It’s usually like a kid in front of Subway sandwiches with a sign and earbuds and like, fuck my life. My dad blows those assholes out of the water. He’s out there high-kicking. He’s pelvic thrusting. There’s a lot of raising the roof. He’s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Carry Him In. He’s a gorilla in front of Gold’s Gym. He’s a slice of pizza. Has anyone seen my dad? In the Orlando area? Real question, I like to ask, ’cause one time I think I was in Houston, a guy went, yo, is your dad, the fireman in front of Firehouse Subs. And I was like, yes, that’s my maker. He also does a fairly offensive portrayal of a Mexican in front of this place called Tijuana Flats, but he’s been doing it for 29 years, so at this point it is on them. If you call my dad’s number, he’ll answer and he’ll be like Stars on Call, this is Bert. Yeah, you want Chef Big Butt from three to five? No problem, I’ll send a man out. Always him. Nobody else works for that company. He’s a genius. I guess technically his wife. He found somebody to marry him down in Orlando and sometimes she’ll zip up his morph suit. As kids always felt like on our visits, my dad would like consistently choose our stepmom over me and my sisters, and like, I get it. You know, she gave him head and all we had were questions. But my dad has been in Orlando now for so long his personality is very much Fox news. Like, I mean, he’s so MAGA, he’s stealing jobs from the Mexicans. Growing up, we’d have these weekly calls that you have with your divorced parents and he would spew a fairly feminist rhetoric. He would always say, girls, remember to get the education you need to get the job you need, to get the car and the house you need. Then worry about the husband. And then in high school he started calling us and saying things like, if you ever get pregnant, I’ll take the baby. What? I don’t think he meant steal it, I think he meant take it and raise it. I wish more anti-choice people were like him. Like if you have it, I’ll take it. But they’re not, they just want you to have it. And then you never hear from ’em again. No thank you note, no money, it’s rude. I’m sure you’re wondering how hard it must’ve been for my mom to watch my dad go off and become a big star… on call, none-the-less. She’s fine. She’s currently sleeping with this very handsome, cavalier King Charles spaniel. His name is Nigel. She loves him. I feel like all he does is just try to eat her food and put his dick on our good pillows. I’ve been replaced. She sort of… She likes to update me on what they’re up to if they’re hanging and stuff. One time she sent me a photo of Nigel on the front ',\n",
       "  'porch. You know when a dog like splays their back legs out equally. So the hind is like, peuwww, you know what I mean? I better do it. Sorta like, when the dog is like fully flat, just like you know what I mean, it’s like penis to pavement, just like cooling his dick off on the cement. My mom sent me a photo of Nigel like this on the front porch, in the caption she wrote, it’s pretty hot here. I was like, ew. Is this a sext? Is this Nigel? My mom… Can you just imagine the dog, like ticka-ticka-tick… My mom has been out of the game for a while. I took her on a retirement trip and we were out to eat, we must have run out of things to talk about ’cause at the end of the meal I asked my mom, have you ever gotten a dick pic? She goes a nickel? I was like, what? Never mind, I don’t know why I even asked you that. Is anybody here with their mom? Oh you, good, I love it when people come with their mom, especially if I talk about something sexual, it’s so fun to look at you guys, because you’re usually like, I don’t know, are we laughing? Which I chalk up to like a sexual spectrum of mother, how moms raise their kid in regard to sex. ‘Cause on one side of the sexual spectrum, some moms are like, sex does not exist. And then their kids go away to college and they’re like, yes it does. And then there are moms on the opposite side of the sexual spectrum who say things like, hi honey, how was your orgasm? And you’re like, ew. I will not be coming home for Thanksgiving. Thankfully I didn’t have to deal with that. My mom is 100% a virgin. When she does start dating, I’m going to have to ask her like, how was your date? And then she’ll say, I don’t know, we were kissing, and then his penis got sharp. I don’t have to explain it to my mom. My sisters, on the other hand, love to bone. They like to have sex, get fertilized, wait for it to go from embryo, to fetus, to baby. And then they birth the baby. It’s like their thing. Whenever my oldest sister’s pregnant, her husband likes to announce it, and he’ll always say, “We’re pregnant!” Which has historically irked some people because they feel like the woman is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I, however, have turned a corner and I like it, I do. ‘Cause it did, it took two people to do that thing, which is why I like to practice with all the men in my crowd before we go. I just like to practice saying we’re pregnant on three. So all the men in the crowd on three, we’ll say, “we’re pregnant.” One, two, three. We’re pregnant. Okay, you’re also drunk. Not everybody did it. If that didn’t resonate with you, I guess you could just go home and practice. We’re aborting. That’s honestly where we could use your help the most. For some reason, the stigma of abortion is just fully on a woman, it’s bonkers. Back where I’m from in Ohio, they were talking about putting a woman in prison if she gets an abortion and I’m like, eh, she had an accomplice. We haven’t had a Mary since that first one. And even then you’re telling me that God stopped at one kid. The self-restraint there is admirable. Like God just had Jesus and then we lost him. You think he’d try again. I just feel like mortal men, sometimes it feels like mortal men, you’re more careful pouring a beer than you are with your jizz. Just like, ooh, ooh, not too much head. It is like the only time you say that. And then privately you’re just spreading biomedical hazard, like…gooogggg I don’t blame you. Nobody teaches enough about this stuff. Some people don’t even like hearing the word abortion. But as long as birth control is hard for a lot of people to get and boners are hard to keep in condoms, they’re going to happen. I think we just got to stop looking at abortion like leftovers. Hear me out, keep breathing through the joke. Imagine it like this. Like a couple goes out for a big meal and they over-order, they’re reckless, they’re probably wasted. And at the end of the meal, there’s a bunch of leftovers and the dude says, you take them. And the woman says, oh, I don’t want them, you take them. And the dude says I can’t, I don’t have a fridge. And she asks then why did you put it in the box? You shouldn’t have put it in the box. Now we’re going to have to throw it away. And the dude says, “Okay, do you want me to like walk you to a trash can?” And then for some reason on the way to the trash can, there’s only random people yelling at her, like, “You wasteful bit',\n",
       "  'ch!” She’s like, what, he paid for half? I’m just saying abortion is not really the time to go Dutch, maybe treat her. And of course there’s a lot of good men out there. I was living in Bloomington, Indiana, and I saw a man praying in front of the Planned Parenthood. And I imagined that he was just saying like, dear God, please make sure that Brenda came here on Wednesday when she said she would. So there’s some good ones. Whenever my sisters are pregnant at the same time– like that’s happened simultaneously a couple times– people can’t help themselves, they always ask me like, did they plan it? I’m just like what does that look like for you? Do you think one of my sisters called the other and said, hey, what’s up, what are you doing? And the other was like, I don’t know, what are you doing? No. I don’t know what the season is for unprotected sex, but I think it’s always in Ohio. I have so many nieces and nephews running around, I can’t keep track. Sometimes I just have to wait for them to like play in a group, and then I shout out a name like, “Charlotte” and wait for one to turn. Get over here, let’s connect. I don’t even know what I would name kids if I had them. Obviously Jeremy, your parents struggled. I had a friend who actually named their daughter Harbor because she and her husband conceived her in this beautiful hotel in a harbor, which is truly disturbing. If my family did that, we would have so many Alleys and Sofas. Maybe like one The Woods, I’m from Ohio. And then what, they’re just supposed to call me mom? There’s already so many. I didn’t even know my mom had a first name until recently. I’d just been calling her mom for so long. And then she phoned me up and asked why haven’t you followed me back on Instagram? I was like, who’s Diane? I don’t even know if I would respond to mom. I’ve been called a female comic Ss many times I’d respond better to girl daddy. Just imagine my future imaginary son, like the last to get picked up, at probably afternoon kindergarten. And his teacher walks over to him and asks, Van, is your mother coming? And then he’ll be like, no, my girl dad is, she’s just always late. She’s probably picking up my sister, Shallow Grave. You guys have been so great. Thank you for listening.

       " ['[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have',\n",
       "  ' the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut o',\n",
       "  'ff, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that wa',\n",
       "  'lked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no u',\n",
       "  'p and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen.',\n",
       "  ' So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac!',\n",
       "  ' How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, ',\n",
       "  'but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork c',\n",
       "  'hop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while',\n",
       "  ', you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

       " ['Dylan Moran’s What It Is (2009) offers a sweeping exploration of human foibles, societal observations, and the complexities of life through the lens of stand-up comedy. Moran navigates topics ranging from the absurdity of consumerism, the nuances of language barriers, and the cultural peculiarities of different countries, to personal anecdotes about aging, relationships, and the quest for happiness amidst life’s mundane realities. He explores the human condition with a mix of cynicism and whimsy, using his unique blend of eloquence and humor to critique modern life while also reflecting on the universal struggle for meaning and connection. Through his performance, Moran invites the audience into a world where laughter serves as a coping mechanism for the existential dread that pervades our daily lives, encouraging a collective introspection on what it truly means to be human in a rapidly changing world. * * * (HELP ME BY JUNIOR WELLS PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome to the stage Dylan Moran? (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Hello! You’re here. Hello, hello. Uh… I don’t know! You know, you come in, wanting stuff. I don’t know what you want. I don’t know what anybody wants. I don’t know what I want. MAN IN AUDIENCE: We want you. Yeah, yeah. You say that. I get that, you know. Where’s the cake? Cake is the language of love. I don’t see any cakes in the building. You know, people say that to you in your life. They go, “I love you, I love you.” Yeah? Give me a fucking éclair. Nobody… No, we don’t need to eat any more, anyway. You know, people in the English-speaking nations generally don’t. Even the poor. We’re all overfed. Eating is a purely recreational thing now. So why fuck around with soup, or chicken, or any of that stuff? Just cake. I live in Scotland. Have you been to Scotland? See, that’s the exact same number of people as answer that question in the affirmative when I ask it in England. And people… English people don’t go up there, it’s nearly half the country, and they don’t go up, and you say, “Why don’t you go?” And they go, “Oh, well, you know, it’s very dark and dreary.” ‘Cause they get so used to the crocodiles and the tropical storms down there in England and they… “Dark and dreary, you can’t understand the accent, the food’s disgusting, a lot of violence, a lot of drugs, people injecting Temazepam into each other’s stumps and… Otherwise I’d go, you know.” It’s nonsense, anyway. It’s a beautiful accent in Scotland. There’s a lot of Scottish people here in this country. You know the voice. You’ve heard it before. It’s very easy to understand. Before I was in Australia, the last place I was in was in Glasgow. I was in an off-licence buying some cigarettes, blending in with the local women and children and I… There was a young man in front of me, very friendly, with a whole case of beer balanced on his stomach. And he turned round to me and he said, (MUMBLING INCOMPREHENSIBLY) And I didn’t quite know what was on offer, but that doesn’t stop you joining in a conversation. You just take out your best middle-class smile, you know, and go… (LAUGHING) He could have been asking me anything, I don’t know. It’s kind of an abuse of a smile though, really, ’cause smiles are important. They should be used for, you know, when you really mean something, you feel it very deeply. This is just one of those “please don’t kill me, I’m just off a train” smiles. And Scottish people are quite bigoted about the English. You know, I have to remind them of the incredible English sophistication and tolerance and sense of humour, which they need to deal with their impotence and pointlessness. Then there… There is no point being sensitive about where you’re from because it doesn’t matter, you know? I mean, Irish people, very recently, were voted one of the ugliest people in the world. That didn’t bother me. It just made me look a bit harder at Irish people. I can see what it’s about. We’re a pretty rugged bunch. All Irish people look like they’re trying to hide other people inside them. Even newborn babies have that look. Like they’ve had a serious go at an international rugby career at some point. It doesn’t matter, at all. You know, everybody is in the same position. Looking for, trying to look for something, anything to believe in. Here, you have… Your prime minister has an approval rating of 75%. Which is… What’s he doing? Nobody ever gets 75%. Is he coming round at night with a pot roast, touching you on the knee and telling you you’ve lost weight? What’s going on? This is madness. Nobody gets 75%. Not even when you’re madly in love with somebody and you’re both fucking each other’s brains out, do you give each other 75%. You’ve got to hold a bit back, keep the other person guessing, you know. Keep it at a steady 40. And since I’ve been here, you know, there’s a lot of talk in Sydney and a couple of other places about the whole biking problem, which is, as far as I’m concerned, kind of a problem about language. Now, most people obviously on their motorcycles just… It’s a very good place to be on a motorcycle. It’s a great country to see, you know, from a bike, going, “Look, there’s… Never mind.” And the… ‘Cause the, you know, it goes on for ages but… And then you get a few people who happen to have motorcycles, but who are mainly violent lunatics. Who, um, who would be violent lunatics if they had a kite. And they… Or just a rubber duck, they’d still be insane. The thing is, you can’t deal with the public because of what you call them. Because you call them bikies, which is a really Australian thing where you diminutise everything, you know, you make an “ee”. Everything you put a little “ee, ee, ee, ee” on everything. You can’t address the problem like that. “Oh, it’s a bikie. He’s coming at me with a knifey. “I’m in the morguey.” And then you do this other weird stuff, like with words that are really short, you make them unnecessarily longer. Like “yes” you turn into “yeeeeeah”. Or “noooooo”. Which is the exact same sound you get if you put something up, or indeed take it out, of a cat. And, uh, language here is… It’s kind of a, kind of a… you know, worldwide, it’s the same here as it is in lots of Europe as well. Much more Americanised. I mean, you really notice that now. They, you know, 50 years, 20 years ago, Jesus, 10 years ago, people would’ve said, somebody would’ve said something like, “Well, you know, I was quite nervous about seeing him, actually, “but in the end he was very quick to reassure me and we had a lovely evening.” Now, that’s just become, “I was like ‘uh’, he was like ‘duh’.” Something’s lost there. Now, I don’t know why I’m talking about that, ',\n",
       "  'but anyway, the um… Yes, you see the thing is, it doesn’t matter where you’re from. It’s that they’re talking about the recession here. They’ve just begun that. And it’s a very boring subject, but you’ve no idea how boring it is. ‘Cause it’s only just started here. For months, they just, you know, they sort of went, (GARBLED) “…recession.” There’s a little, “Yeah, don’t have that other slice of cake just yet.” But that’s been going on in Europe for months and months and months. People, you know… And then everybody ignored it ’cause it started out, they’re going, “There seems to be a bit of a recession, a slight… Yeah. Anyway, next news, there was a dog who got sick on somebody,” and all that stuff. And then the next day they come out with, “Actually, it’s quite bad. It’s crisp.” “Yeah. Oh. Fuck it,” and then the next day it was just… You know, nobody watches the news now ’cause all the newsreaders are in rags and you turn it on and they’re going… (GROANING) “A baby sold its eyes to pay for its teeth.” (GROANING) It’s too fucking depressing. People don’t read the newspapers any more, they just run home and beat the televisions with them. I don’t know why I’m doing this. I’m just prepared, you know? Um… (STUTTERING) The… Yeah, I don’t know. I mean, I don’t. My mind is going, anyway, I’ve been here a long time. I’ve been on the road for too long. I know I have, ’cause I was in a supermarket the other day and I saw this… I saw this tiny, heartbreaking can of beans. And it really made me want to cry. I just thought, “How old or sick or small do you have to be to need those beans?” And it was on a high shelf, you know? You’d be climbing the ladder for days just to get at those four beans. These are beans that somebody else would have to feed you ’cause of the huge accident you just had, you know? You pop them in with a bean-shooter through the gap in a person’s teeth when they’re up in plaster of Paris lying in the bed there, and you go… One bean for every day in the week. So, yeah, it’s been a while. And the, um… But that is absolutely true about, you know, people needing to believe in things. And it’s a scary thing when you start to believe in politicians. You can’t trust them. You see, but we need to believe something. And you’re not allowed to believe in religion. Well, you can, but people will laugh at you and throw things. ‘Cause it was just sort of decided in the 20th century that religion is basically a formalised panic about death. That’s all. I mean, look at the Catholic Church, the campest organisation on the planet, with the purple robes, gold bits on the side, jewellery so big if they let it fall it will kill people. What else can it be but this sort of ritual of panic about death? “Death is coming! Quick, put on the gold hat.” They’re… You see, people never really grow up. I don’t mind most religious people. I talk to them. You know, I listen to them banging on. “I prayed very hard and then the fairy came.” “Did he? Good. Have a biscuit.” I only get annoyed when they try and make me see the fairy. “You have to let the fairy into your heart.” “Look, I wouldn’t let him into my garden, okay? “I’d shoot him on sight, if he existed, which he doesn’t. “Now, have another biccie and be quiet, will you, please?” But you can absolutely understand the desire to believe in something to support you, you know? I mean, children like to be supervised by adults, you know, that’s why children go, “Look, no hands,” or, “Look, I can do this.” “Look, I’m really good at this,” whatever it is. ‘Cause it validates them. It shows them that they are there, ’cause somebody else is watching over them. Grownups are the same. Not that there is any such thing as a grownup, really. They want to be, the idea they like to be watched by something, you know. ‘Cause, I mean, the planet’s not going to miss us when we finish fucking it up and killing each other. So we needed the idea of God to have somebody to miss us, or at least notice that we weren’t there any more. ‘Cause we’ve all died out, ’cause we’ve fucked it up. And God will go, “Look, they’re not there. The lizards are doing quite well, though. “Good on them.” But we’re sort of gradually growing out of that now. You know, I passed a church a couple of days ago and saw one of those signs you see outside churches, it said, “Jesus said, ‘I am the light of the world.”‘ Which is very male view. You know, if Jesus had been Jesusina, it would have been more modest. You know, ’cause it’s a woman. It would traditionally have to be more modest. Jesusina would have gone, “Well, I’m quite bright.” And because, uh, you know, ’cause you have dreams, they need to go somewhere, so they go into belief and thus we get very extreme people, obviously, in any religion. But with suicide bombers, one of the things I don’t understand is what’s in it for the women suicide bombers? ‘Cause with the men, it’s a very male kind of promise at the end of it. “Seventy-two virgins.” A man, I think, thought of that. And, um… But I bet you what women are offered is much more modest. It’s probably, you know, flexible working hours and decent childcare at the end of it, something like that. But anyway, look. So you don’t, people don’t believe in religion any more. What do they believe in? You can’t go to politics. You can’t. Look at them. For fuck’s sake. Look at Vladimir Putin. How can you? He cultivates the idea of being a gangster. He just loves it. How can you trust anybody who looks like they’ve been cloned from a dead shark? Or Berlusconi in Italy, right? The envy of the world, Italy, in terms of history, art and culture. Ninety-eight different political parties and they still managed to elect him. He so fucking crooked he sleeps on a spiral staircase. So thoroughly corrupt, every time he smiles, an angel gets gonorrhoea. He’s had so many facelifts his face has moved to the top of his head, you have to get on a stepladder to watch him lie. You can’t trust any of them. And we all think that we’re very rational and very secular. But we make gods all the time. Everybody went apeshit when Barack Obama got elected. I was delighted. Everybody was thrilled. A sane, rational, intelligent human being in an important office. Great. But his biggest problem is everybody else, is us. ‘Cause everybody’s in love with him. He stands up there, he’s very convincing and commanding, and makes sense, says it’s a difficult time, everybody needs to work together and be realistic about what we’ve got to do and all that stuff. And everybody is looking at him going, “No! You do it! “You are Super Jesus. “You’re so handsome when you’re serious. “Do you work out?” And, uh… Where else can you go? I mean',\n",
       "  ', you know, people talk about technology and science all the time. But that’s bollocks. People come in here with their fucking camera phones, everything is a camera nowadays. You pick up a piece of fruit, it takes a picture of you. Or the computers, which are everywhere, which is proof that we like to be watched. That’s what we replaced God with, technology. We’re fucking afraid to be alone in a lift, in a taxi cab. We need cameras everywhere, recording us, unless we realise we’re alone, we might do something scary. Like whimper, I don’t know. But then… The machines… You know, the laptop I have, all it does is tell me to fuck off in 400 different ways, I don’t understand it. You open it up and it goes, “Ba-jing! What’s the magic word?” I don’t know. That’s why I got you. I have no memory. Don’t go fucking “ba-jing” anyway, why can’t you be more like me? When I open you up, you should go… (GARBLING) “What?” And science… is a joke. Look at the scientific explanation for the origin of life as we know it. It has a major flaw. I mean, it’s no wonder we have creationists. You know, those people, God love them, who tell their children that, you know, originally, we all went to school with the dinosaurs, or whatever it is that they tell them. But no wonder they exist because listen to the explanation for the origin of life itself. It doesn’t sound very scientific. There was a big bang. And then we all came from monkeys. “What, that’s it?” “Yeah, shop’s closed, fuck off.” I need more than that. There must be more than, bang! (IMITATING MONKEY) “Honey, I’m home!” Come on! It’s such a boring theory, anyway. It’s much more interesting if you reverse the order. So, there’s that and then the other thing that we seem to have bought into in a big way is consumerism. That’s what people use, they fill the void, you know, stuff. Give me the thing, give me the couch, the wig, the tiny beans, the radio, the CDs, the fricking shoes, all the stuff, all the time, that you can’t get away from. You know you bought a lot of shit ’cause you’re broke now. And your house is full of shit. You walk around the house looking for a pencil or a piece of paper, you can’t find anything useful like that but you can always put your hands on a purple furry cube with the number six on the side and rubber legs underneath. And you pick it up and you go, “What is this shit? Why is it in the house?” ‘Cause you bought it, that’s why. Like all the other crap you never use. There’s people in the middle of Sydney driving around in those huge 4×4 vehicles. They’re like little houses on the move. You can’t even see the people inside, they’re so high up. The man on the mobile phone is going, “Blah, blah, blah!” about money. Or the ladies with the Roman candle of blonde hair going, “Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!” As they plough through schoolchildren. Roaring around. (ROARING) Up and down the street where your children play in their fucking Toyota Hiroshimas. So they can get to the mall quicker to buy more shit, to put it in the house! The jewellery, the clothes, the perfume. Perfume is a good example of a product gone all wrong. When I was a child, that was a sort of semi-exotic thing, you know? And it was called something stupid, like Fleur de Fleurs. And you would give it to your mother or an auntie at Christmas. And it was advertised by some dopey-looking woman in a field of sunflowers. And she looked like she’d been hit by a tractor because she was going… She just couldn’t get over how nice she smelled. Now, because we’re so jaded, we’ve consumed so much, our attention can only be grabbed in a violent way. So it’s always advertised by these constipated, exoskeletal bitches who are sneering at you. And it’s called something horrible like Homicide. Dysentery. Urban Dysentery, for boys and girls. What’s wrong with us? We’re the only organism the planet is actively asking to fuck off by burning things and freezing things and melting things on us. It’s like going past the ocean and seeing it spit out whales. “Fuck off, I’ve had enough of you.” Passing the eucalyptus tree as the koalas hang on. The tree’s going, “Get the fuck away from me!” Now, you’re in the forefront of all that because you’ve got real weather here. Dramatic weather. You open your front door and everything might be gone, or you might be two and a half miles further on down the road, in a flood. In Britain and Ireland, where people talk about the weather all the time, all day, there’s no story, there’s no weather. But Irish people, especially, insist on drama. So you can hear things like, “Oh, it was fierce mild! It was touch and go there for a while.” So… God doesn’t work. Science doesn’t work. Consumerism certainly doesn’t work. So where do you go? Where do you end up? We end up back with each other, there’s nowhere else to go. People. You have a very important, early decision to make in your life. Are you going to be alone, or are you going to be with somebody else? Are you going to be sane, or not Ionely? A couple is a strange thing. It’s an organism that’s half as intelligent as the most intelligent member. And you both know who that is. ‘Cause you’ve got two people walking around together all the time, trying to remember all the different shit they have to lie about to each other. “Oh, we’re going over here, are we? Oh, good, are we going to see those people? “Terrific, oh good, hope it doesn’t stop any time soon.” There’s a lot of pressure on you to find the right person. You’re told if you don’t find the right person your life is fucked. You might as well forget the whole thing. You’re dead! Which is rubbish, there’s billions of you. We’re all the fucking same. It’s not him it’ll be her, or if not him it’ll be them. There’s millions of people for everybody. There’s more than enough. We’re very overstocked on ourselves. But it’s because we all think we’re so fabulous. The first half of your life is all spent getting over yourself, anyway. You know, you would think you’re amazing, unique. Young people walking around going, “You know the funny thing is “I was just in the kitchen but now I’m here in the bedroom. “Get a load of me. I just go on and on.” And that’s around the age when you meet somebody else and you’re totally unbearable. Two young, fit, healthy, attractive people in love? There’s nothing worse to look at in the world. Going around going, “I can’t believe I met you ’cause I’m amazing and you’re amazing, and we’re surrounded by shitheads. “It’s just amazing. “Hey, I know this really good bar. Let’s go and make it better.” In the second half of your life you realise just how like every other hump who drew breath you really are, except you’re more boring. B',\n",
       "  'ut anyway, so there’s a lot of pressure. There’s pressure on a young man to say something snappy and seductive and charming to a young woman in a dance hall or a disco or whatever they’re called now, those places where you walk in and the music makes your internal organs bleed. And it’s very hard ’cause it’s a loaded conversation. It’s about attraction. So, what do you say? You know, what’s the right thing to say? There’s nothing. It’s like talking to the bereaved. There’s no right thing to say. “Hey. “Yeah. Like your clothes and stuff. “You want some gravy?” There’s no… Gravy is not an innuendo. I just mean actual gravy. The, um… Yeah. Fuck, where are you from? The… You know, it’s the same with the bereaved. What can you say? “I am sorry about all the people who died. “Want a little gravy?” It doesn’t work then, either, you know? But there’s too much pressure on you because you’re young and you’re stupid. You should be given some latitude, some licence there. You know, you should just be allowed to walk up and say, “Hey,” and then you can go off together. And do something wonderfully stupid. Like have a gap year. Why not? There’s no other justification for that as far as I can see, anyway. What do young people have gap years for? They haven’t done anything yet. Why don’t they have a full year where they do nine times as much as they’ve ever experienced up to that point? So they know what the rest of adulthood feels like? Which is walking around in a desert with a bag over your head, being bumped into by people who rob you as they bore you. And they always go for some stupid reason as well. “So, where are you going?” “Brazil.” “You bastard. Why?” “‘Cause they have a snake there. “And what it does, it pretends to be asleep and then monkeys come over. “And then it fucks them and eats them.” And… “Well, have a great time in jail with malaria.” The… So, yeah, all that pressure on the young man and the young woman and there’s, you know, tremendous amounts of different kinds of pressure on the young man and the young woman because 7,000 women in Britain alone went for cosmetic breast surgery last year, which is… You think, “Why?” I mean, a tiny number of them might have needed some medical attention. The rest just thought they weren’t good enough. You know, they needed something else, big, small, square. Maybe wrap-around. (ROLLS TONGUE) I don’t know. But… You must be pretty insecure to go to a surgeon and say, “What I want you to do is put me to sleep with powerful drugs. “While I’m asleep, rip, snip, Frisbee away different bits of me, stick in two weather balloons, sew it up, wait until I’m groggy and deranged and bloody and wake me up and then give me demands for money.” You know, you can’t think that much of yourself. You know, nobody’s tits are perfect. Not even mine, and I have spent thousands on every inch of myself. These fingers are from Florence. Yves Saint Laurent himself designed my arse. My nipples are reconstructed from an early, unfinished blueprint by Coco Chanel. Hence, their lopsided charm. One of them is on my shoulder. The other five I keep handy between my toes, which themselves are a bit embarrassing but fuck it, it was the ’80s, you had to have suede. And the… Nothing is perfect. So the young man and the young woman… realise eventually that you don’t die, you know, it’s a huge lie. ‘Cause the young man knows he’s not dead, ’cause he’s with the young woman now. And they’re in a rented flat, and she’s talking about curtains. And he really, really wants to be dead. ‘Cause the young woman’s been talking about curtains for half an hour and looks like she means to go on, and she’s saying, “What do you think? “Should we get the purple ones with the really subtle blend “into the pink tonalities towards the end? “Or should we get the ones where they look like a tree? “But it’s at night and you’re passing in a car. Which one do you think we should get? “What do you really feel? I can’t make this decision by myself. “What do you really, truly feel?” And what he really truly feels is, “I cannot begin to describe how much I don’t care! “I didn’t know we had windows “until you brought all this shit up, okay?” Stop saying “wallpaper”, “furniture”, “floor”. It’s bourgeois. Eat the chicken from my hat, come on. Now, in a strange way, when you’re young, death is on your mind more. You don’t think about it. You don’t think about anything. You know, I was young once. I remember. You don’t think about anything. You’re very stupid. Young men in particular are very stupid ’cause they’re paralysed by lust. You’d like the luck to spend your time looking at young women, going, “Ahh! Ahhh! Oh, oh, ah! “Please! Please, let me help you, please. “Take me home. I could hold parts of you while the rest of you gets on with tasks. “Please! Come on.” Stand on the same street corner for days at a time. Now, I still see them, of course. Sometimes I still stop and stare. But different things go through my mind now with time passing, you know? I look at them and I go, “Ahh! “Ha-ha! “Give me your kidneys. “You’re wasting them! “Fucking fruit and salad. Come on, I need backup here. “I’ll give you a pair of shoes.” So, yes. Death. When you’re young, you think about it. You don’t really think about it, you know. You have the intelligence of raspberry jam. You’re not thinking about anything. But it’s there as a mode of force, making you do things. Go and get a job, go and find a flat. Find somebody else. Put them in the flat. Make them stay. Get a toaster. Go to work. Get on the bus. Look at your boss. Say “fuck”. Sit down. Pick up the thing. Go blank. Scream internally. Go home. Listen to the radio. Look at the other person. Think, “Why, why did this happen?” Go to bed. Lie awake, at night. Get up. Feel groggy. Put the things on, your clothes, whatever they’re called. Go out the door. In to work. Same thing, same people again. It’s real. It is happening to you. Home again. Sit. Radio. Dinner. Hmm. Gardening, gardening, gardening! Death. So… (AUDIENCE WHOOPING) The young woman thinks if she can get the right curtains, she can keep death and all attendant problems at bay. But the young man knows that the only way to keep death at bay is to have sex pretty much constantly. Now, because nature’s so clever, it makes the couple compromise by giving them children, so they never need to have sex again, and then the children pull the curtains down. So there was nothing to worry about in the first place. If they do have children… Now, if you don’t have children, if you’re a young man and you don’t have children, you won’t give a shit about anything I’m about to say for about the next five minutes, probably. ‘',\n",
       "  'Cause young men especially, all men, in fact, don’t even see children. They’re just other beings that want instant gratification. They’re competition as far as men are concerned. Children are part of a woman’s life from when she’s very young. She’s brought up to look after other people. So, you know, I was aware of that going out with people in my 20s. You’d be walking along the street with somebody and the woman would go, “Oh, look at that! Look at this tree. Isn’t that beautiful? You could put a baby up there.” Men don’t see them. Until they have one, and then, only when they’re just about to step on them. “Oh! Sorry about that! Sorry about that. What’s that?” “Wah wah”? They want you. They want your something. One of your stuff. And, uh, children obviously change everything, you know, ’cause men have a very narrow focus a lot of the time, especially when they’re doing something… (BUZZING) So, you know, men like plans. I like… You think you do that and then that and then that could happen. So, if you go on holiday with a child, you might think, “Oh, let’s go to the old part of the town. Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. “We’ll go where they have cobblestones and cafés and art galleries and it’ll be really good and we’ll walk around and it’ll be fantastic. “And then we’ll go and we’ll have some kind of nice lunch “in a bistro or something and it’ll be great.” And then the child goes, “Daddy, Daddy, look! A stick!” And you go, “Yeah. Well, we’re going over there to the old part of town ’cause there’s this little place, we’ll go there.” “No, look! The stick is beside some poo.” And you think, “Well, yeah, you’re right! “Fuck it. Let’s make a day of it here. We’ll get a picnic. Why move?” But that takes time. Now, if you… They teach you to how to become a person, really. Because, you know, children are very overprotected now in lots of ways. We’re very nervous about them. Um, you know, people go, “Oh, don’t go outside! “Or inside. Get into the cupboard with some spinach.” And when I was a child, they would kick you out of the house and you weren’t expected to come back till there were bats. Um… So children are kind of… I think they’re neurotic now, they’re scared, you know? They go, “Ahh, a ghost!” And, um… If you have friends who don’t have kids, they can sound very naive, you know? Your single friends without children or people without children, ’cause they ask you stupid things like, “What did you do at the weekend?” “Uh…” As you try to distinguish one moment from any other in the blur of screams, stains and tears that made up Saturday and Sunday, they will tell you what they did, which is all they ever wanted to do in the first place. “We went to that really cool place, you know the one you haven’t heard of? Yeah, they make their own tomatoes out of vodka? It was great. And then we walked along the canal. We hired one of those hop-on, hop-off hot air balloons, just so in case we got bored walking, you know, we could go in the balloon for a bit and then we could walk for a bit. And then, you know, I think we saw some French double-bill of old movies. Which reminded us we hadn’t had sex in about a half an hour. So we did again. And then we went and we did that, you know, we’re both in a band. Yeah, it’s doing really well. It’s called Black Yogurt. We did this sort of lunchtime gig. And… In that really, really cool place, you know, the cellar that’s above the building. It’s… It’s called Umlaut. Well, it’s not called Umlaut, it’s just two dots over a U that isn’t there. And then… Saw loads of people from all over the world and saw several art galleries and went to about five operas and some production of ballet. It was really good. I think I was in it. And then we had sex again and… Yeah, then we just ended the evening with some of that Japanese pizza. It’s on stilts. It’s really nice.” And then… And then it comes back to you what you did. You go, “Oh, yeah, I remember. I scraped hardened Weetabix off a kitchen tabletop for two and a half hours and then I tried to have a shit. It didn’t quite work out but there’s a window on Wednesday, I think. You should come round. We’ll make an evening of it.” But before any of that can happen, the couple get a chance to celebrate their togetherness in the new life, if they’ve chosen to be together. And one of the big ways people do that is by torturing each other with the English language, because it’s cheap and available, or indeed any language that they know how to speak. Um, people will kill you over time. They will shave out every last morsel of fun in you with little, harmless-sounding phrases that people use every day. Like, “Be realistic! Can’t you just for half a second be realistic?” Now, what that means is, “See reality my way or die!” Which is why you end up in a warehouse, choosing a toilet, for the entire weekend. And nobody ever said to anybody, “Be realistic. Let me oil you.” Sometimes it’s just, you know, insulting. “It’s all sex with you, isn’t it? Eh?” “No. No, it’s not. No. I resent that. Sometimes I want a snack during.” Sometimes it is fiendishly clever. Like, “Why are you in a bad mood?” See, that’s genius. You have to break that down to understand it. Somebody has said to you, “Why have you chosen to feel awful, thereby making me aware of you? Because I have no choice in the matter. And why do I continue to live with you, even though you are so gravely mentally ill and I don’t get any government money.” First thing in the morning, when nobody should be speaking, my wife says things like, “You look terrible!” “What? Am I sick?” “No, no. You just look old and terrible. Morning, morning.” “That’s an awful thing to say to somebody!” “It’s because I care about you. Don’t say hello to the children, you’ll frighten them. Sort yourself out upstairs.” But you get to hear really good things as well, like, you know, the phrases that would have just died out otherwise, like, eh… “How dare you!” Straight from Victorian theatre. People love talking like that. They feel 12 feet tall. “How dare you!” Running home from work to find the other person, they go, “Where are you? I know you’re here somewhere. There you are. How dare you!” “What the fuck do you mean ‘how dare I’? Have you got a raygun in your pocket or something? Shut up.” My favourite one is, “I know what you’re thinking!” “Oh, do you? Do you really? Well done. I know what you’re thinking, too. I know what everybody’s thinking. They’re thinking, ‘I’d like to be lying face down in a cushion, with my mouth full of chocolate, and something lovely happening to my lower half. Do you want your prize now or later?” But there is something going on right now in the world, which means th',\n",
       "  'at I think things, guys are changing. Men. Now, they don’t want… Basically, there’s loads of it here. I’ve noticed loads of it in this country. And there’s loads of it where I live. And you look at them and it just hit me one day very forcefully. They don’t want to grow up, ’cause they’re wearing children’s clothes. You know, I see loads of guys and they are in their 30s and 40s, shuffling around in t-shirts with you know, “Zap” or “Pow” or whatever on it. And they’ve got ambiguous length trousers. They’re not shorts, they’re not trousers. They’re just these things that say, “I don’t want an executive position anytime soon, okay? “I’m having a milkshake for about the next 10 years. “Stay the fuck away from me.” And they hang around together with another guy and they’re not romantically involved. And they stay inside, these are men, remember, inside the house, playing video games! I think this is amazing. You know what I mean. Bip, bip. Bip, bip. I don’t understand the names of them but you know, a world of bip. Bip, bip, bip. (SLURPING) Milkshake, bip. Zap, bip, bip, bip, bip. A few generations ago, at this age they would have been dead by now. And they’re going, “Bip! Dude, you got more bips than me. “I am so gay.” So, women are having children much later. Do you know the average age of a woman having a child in this country? Do you? Eighty-nine years old. That’s right! Waiting for these fucks to grow up. ‘Cause what have they got to pass on to their children? Apart from “Watch out for the snakes on level six.” What is the… Oh, bloody… Right. Um, I have to go now so that you can go and have a something. Do you want a something? AUDIENCE: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right, then. Go and have something, I’ll see you shortly. Thank you, bye. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Okay, what did you do in the interval? (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) Something nice. That’s what people do, that’s what everybody does. You have to do something nice. (STUTTERING) I can’t remember what I did. But it was nice. Oh, yeah. I ate some chocolate. I’m going to eat some more. Um, you know, you have to have a good relationship with pleasure. Australians seem to, on the whole. Your approach seems to be to go, “What’s that? “Ah, yeah, it’s one of those.” Which is a lot healthier than the Irish one, which is to go, “What’s that? That looks nice. “I’ll wait till everyone’s asleep, “then I’ll steal it, “so nobody will see me enjoy myself and then I won’t have to feel ashamed. “I can just let the guilt fester for the rest of my life and spend all of my remaining years drunk.” But if you want to see a really twisted attitude to pleasure, you have to be talking to an English person, because they’re very strange. They get very coy and very childish around pleasure. You offer an English person something and they go… (LAUGHING) “Well then, if we’re going to be a little bit naughty, “go on, then, I’ll have a nibble.” And you think, “It’s a fucking bun. Eat it! “I’m not offering you flamingo fucking genitals “flash-fried in orchid oil here.” You have to be honest about all that stuff. Otherwise you’ll go strange. You’ll turn into one of those people you don’t like. You know, one of your friends. The one you ring up and say, “Hi, how are you?” And they go, “I’m fine.” (GIGGLING) And you think, “No, you’re not. “You’re making very inappropriate noises on the phone. “You need to sleep with twins, today.” There is a young woman who works in my local grocery shop. And I don’t go in there any more ’cause she’s so repressed. She speaks to me the same way she speaks to everybody else. You go in there and you put your grapes or butter or whatever it is you’re getting in front of her and she goes, “Hi. How are you?” (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) And you think, “I’m fine. This relationship has gone way beyond its parameters already. “I can’t get involved in all the murders you need to commit “to get this shit out of your system. “Please go and do something you enjoy soon before you kill everybody with a label gun.” You know, I think that women are not allowed to be seen to enjoy themselves in lots of ways. They have a test for that in Ireland now. They’ve scientifically perfected that, the Madonna Whore Quotient of a woman. You know, if when a woman puts her hands together to pray, and when she’s crying the blood and she levitates, if you don’t get a sustained hum in A flat, she’s a fucking whore! We sorted that out. And… You know, if you’re not honest about pleasure, if you’re not honest about what you want, you’ll become strange. You’ll turn into one of those freaks, those people who have hobbies. You know, somebody gets a load of coat hangers and buttons, runs into a shed, you don’t see them for three days and then they come out, going, “Look, the Taj Mahal!” No, it’s not. Put it away. And no, I don’t want to see all the plates you’ve nailed to a bath. Stay away from me, you fucking weirdo! Or the horse you made out of your own hair and spit. Just keep away. There was a time when people were more honest about all that stuff. You know, people creep up on pleasure now in a very odd way. There’s people out there called “furries”. Have you heard of them? MAN: Yes. They dress up as woodland animals. And they meet for tea and biscuits. I don’t know if it’s a sex thing. I hope so. I want to see a giant bilby fuck a giant wombat as much as the next person. But within that relationship you’ve got to be honest and mature. You can’t say to somebody, “I need you to dress up as a bilby. “This isn’t working for me.” They might have spent the last three-quarters of an hour shoehorning themselves into that numbat costume. You have to be respectful. And then there’s the S&M crowd. And that all sounds very odd at first. You know, people… You know the ones, people who like to be nailed and stapled into things. Put in old fridges and left under the stairs for weeks. They love all that. And that sounds odd at first, but it has an emotional logic, ’cause people speak about it and they say, “Well, it makes me feel safe.” You see? I can see where they’re going with that. I mean, you could grow up… I grew up in Ireland and, you know, you learn to feel bad about anything you enjoy. It’s in the air. It’s Catholicism. You know, you see a sunset. You go, “Look at that. “Isn’t that extraordinarily beautiful?” “We’re not allowed.” “Okay, look at the mud. Look at the mud. The mud everywhere, the mud. “I am made of mud. Everything is mud. Mud.” Sunsets were for Protestants. (MAN WHOOPING) But you’re mature and you let go of all that baggage. I don’t mind telling you my thing now. What I quite like, I don’t care who knows it, what I quite like is to get a couple of scoops of mushy peas, ',\n",
       "  'stick one under each arm and fling myself at a brick wall. I don’t know what it is. I just feel wanted, you know? You gotta do a bit of what you enjoy! People were more honest about all this stuff in times gone by. You know, I’m talking about… I’m talking about when men were men and women were women. There was an earlier time when women were also men but they worked it out. Now, this is not nostalgia. I have no time for nostalgia. All that rubbish, people going, “Two dollars for a Mars bar? I remember when…” What! What do you remember? “Fucking slavery. Shut up! “When children had to live underground, turning the big wheels.” No, I’m just talking about a different time. This is when a man would receive a phone call in a pub. On a landline. And it would be for him. Men died in pubs. Sometimes on the phone. Frequently with a large ham under their arm. This is when a man would express a strong opinion on a subject he knew nothing about as a point of honour. And to emphasise his position, he would take off his hat, so you would see his comb-over. Which was nothing to be ashamed of. It might rise in the breeze like a cobra or a live cable, but it belonged to him. Or he might have that very… That haircut you don’t see any more. The very, very thin white hair that you can see through to the flock wallpaper at the back of the man. Wonderful, thin, white hair. People shave it off now ’cause they think it looks cooler. The fools! They’re missing out on this fantastic look of purely theoretical hair. It looks like a thought bubble clinging to the skull. This is also in the time when a woman had women’s things. You would go to some social gathering. A woman wasn’t there, you would enquire after her, “Where is Jeannie?” And be told, “Oh, Jeannie, she has women’s things.” And you respected that. Nobody knew what they were. She could have been at home squirting jam into envelopes. Polishing an onion with her feet. It was none of your fucking business. Knitting a ceiling cosy. Let her get on with it! This was also in the time when a woman, I am talking about a real woman here, had a vanity table in the bedroom. To have somewhere, somewhere, to sit and weep. About all the terrible things done to her by men. ‘Cause women have memories. Short, medium, long. They’ve got it all. A woman remembers something you said 17 years ago! And the way you looked at her just now. And to aid that memory, the woman would open a hat box full of precious things. The Curly Wurly wrapper that meant so much! The bundle of letters too painful to look at or throw away. They have to be kept so they can never be looked at. A 9-speed, duel shaft, triple action… No, that’s a different time, a different time. Women remember, this is why we have a civilisation. A woman looks at a man and says, “You tried that yesterday. It didn’t work then, either.” Men do not have memories. Every woman is an individual walking time capsule. Men don’t know anything. Men don’t know when their lives became so thoroughly awful. When everybody else turned into such a tosser. A man does not know how he came by the half a pie he is holding in his hand. And scientists, those frauds, seize on this and try and use it as proof of the mysteries of human consciousness and the unknowable nature of the brain, which is rubbish. The brain is the simplest organ in the body. It only has three bits. There’s the front bit which is the bit you scratch when you come in at half one in the morning and the person you live with says, “Where the fuck were you?” The middle bit, which tries to come up with the excuse. And the back bit, which plays the last song that was on in the pub. “I was with Ralph. You know Ralph. He smells of cucumber. “You can move it, you can check it. You can do it you can do it at the hop. “Don’t speak to me like that, anyway.” “I got you a fricking present on the way home. “Did you get me a present? Did you? Did you? “You want some pie?” Men are afraid of women. Everybody knows this. Because of all the gender stereotyping that goes on. All the things that you’re supposed to be. It’s why many young men get a very confusing message thrown at them. The model held up to them is this sort of action hero. James Bond figure or any of the actors who are currently in those films, who, you know, are running around going… (POPPING) Women see that, some women. They look at it and they go, “All that violence, it’s disgusting. Fuck me.” And that’s a mixed message for men. A lot of men don’t know how to talk to women. They think of them as so other. You see a lot of men socially in restaurants, they don’t have a fucking clue. They’re frightened. Frightened of the dramatic weather and the moodscape that a woman can inhabit. You see men looking at them. They don’t know how to talk to the other. Bully them or kid-glove them, they don’t know any other way. “Do you want to… “Do you want to go over there? Do you want to go?” “No? No? I don’t know what I was thinking. I read about it in the paper.” “Apparently some other people went over there and they quite liked it.” “What about… What about over here? Over here looks…” “No, no, no. Insanity, I know. “I’m just going to stand like this until you tell me what you want to do.” ‘Cause they’re afraid of a woman’s contempt. And women, as a group, en masse, do show contempt for men, en masse. Now, a woman might be afraid of an individual violent man, which is very sensible. Everybody should be afraid of an individual violent man. But as a group, you know, you hear a lot of contempt about men. “Oh, look. Look at them. “Look, there they go, one of them is trying to do something.” Men are afraid, women are not. And part of it is just about biology. It’s shameful that we still can’t have an intelligent, productive conversation about these ordinary life events. I mean, it’s two-thousand and… And we still can’t. You know, childbirth, menstruation, all of these things, without which we wouldn’t be here. I mean, you know, as a guy, you ask a woman about childbirth, you try and find out more about it. You say, “Well, how bad is it? What are we talking about here?” You know? How painful? Like what? “Long weekend in Adelaide? What are we… What are we talking about here?” And you don’t get an answer, you get anger. And it always starts with the melon. “Imagine a melon coming through your face! “Fucking stay there, I’ll get a melon, don’t move.” And with mood, you know, men are thrown by a woman’s ability to go from saying “You always fucking do that, you piece of shit!” To “Hiya!” That does throw men. But it’s a myth that men don’t have their own version of PMT. Of course they do. Every woman knows this. It’s a very simple expe',\n",
       "  'riment to conduct. All you’ve got to do is be with a man, wait until he starts doing something and then go up and talk to him. “What? What is it now? I’m opening fish fingers, can’t you see? “You come in here, you’re walking on the floor, “breathing the air like it’s yours, talking and talking. I’m doing something! “Look, they’ve fallen on the floor. Are you happy? Are you happy now? “Every time I try and do something for myself, “you carbonise and then shit on my dreams. “You’re just like your whole family. “Why do I even dare to think I could dream, I could imagine, I could hope?” Now, men imagine that they have memories because they sometimes experience violent déjà vu. A man will grip his girlfriend, wife, partner, and say, “We’ve been here before!” “We’re in the supermarket car park.” “Yes, I know, but we’ve been here before.” “We never go anywhere fucking else, as far as I can see.” (CLEARING THROAT) Excuse me. I have a touch of everything. And the, um… But you know, you… The mind disintegrates. Memory… I never had a memory anyway, but the, um… But everything goes, everything goes. Youth goes and everything goes. You know? That’s why I can’t stand younger people. Healthy people. Healthy, young, attractive people, doing what they want. Bending down and getting up in the same afternoon, it’s revolting. Because I remember that. Being that. And the old people get, you know, they sound… People think they’re dull. They’re not dull, you know. They’re not actually dull. Like, when you watch young people in the street and they’re talking, and they’re doing those handshakes that take three-quarters of an hour. With the amazingly redundant language, “Yeah, yo, dog, kicking back with the chill ride.” What the fuck are you talking about? Why can’t you just say hello? You know, you get so old, you’re grateful when somebody says, “Hello, how are you?” You just fucking tell them. You say, “I’m all right. I’ve got piles, but I’m still masturbating.” Obviously, who’s got the energy for masturbation, you know, but you have to put a bit of spin on things, otherwise you’ll depress people. This is why older people have a reputation for being boring. They’re not boring, they’re just honest. You ask an older person how they are, they will tell you. Say, “Well, you know, I’m all right. “But a very important bit of me turned green and fell off the other day. “It was very annoying, I was in the swimming pool. “They had to get it out with one of those little net things. “Gave it to me in a plastic bag. “Now I have to write a letter of apology to all the children who were there, “the fucking Council.” Because youth vanishes on you. It’s such a surprise. That’s why people say it seems like yesterday. It does, it seems like yesterday. It seems like yesterday to me. I was out drinking tequila with my friends. I mean, tequila. That’s not even a drink! It’s just a way of getting the police around without using a phone. Now, I’m on the phone to those same friends asking them for recipes. “How do you make breadcrumbs?” And you think, “Jesus, what’s happened to me? “Please, don’t let me die in a gardening centre. “Don’t let me turn into one of those people who begins every single fucking conversation with the words “‘I’m not a racist but…”‘ And you see, ’cause you have this illusion all the time that you’re cool. People do. Not just younger people, everybody thinks that. All men do. Ninety-nine point nine percent of men are convinced that they have to live silently with the bitter irony of the twist of fate that means nobody knows they’re really a spy and an amazing guitarist. Men give serious time and thought to, “How would I deal with it “if a rocket came out of that alley right now, would I… “Yeah, I think I’d handle the situation pretty well.” Um… A spy who plays guitar at night. And they… I mean, I basically think, you know, I’m what would have happened if James Dean had lived and discovered carbohydrates and orthopaedic shoes. You have to tell yourself this bullshit just to keep going. ‘Cause you’re constantly being reminded how redundant you are. How am I supposed to feel in the swim of what’s current when I don’t understand what’s going on? Because younger people, my children, steal the future by changing language, everything I relied on. You walk… How can you expect to feel you know what’s going on when you walk down the street and your children say, (SCOFFING) “Look at that church, it’s so random.” “What, is it moving? What do you mean? What are you talking about? “It’s a perfectly ordinary church where people go to get married.” “Marriage, ugh, that’s so gay!” “Look, just… Can we just have some quiet time? Here are some crisps, there you go.” “Crisps! Awesome!” “They’re not awesome, they’re crunchy. If I open them and haggard shafts of light and cherubim and angelic music comes out, “they would be awesome, okay? Mountains and rivers and the fact that I’m still breathing are awesome.” … And then you get told you’re grumpy, you know? (MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY) Things change. Things get taken away. You get told you have to do other stuff you didn’t plan on doing. You know, you have to see doctors. That happens later. This is why old people are described as boring, ’cause they talk about things like that. That’s what they know. “What did you do today?” “Well, I went to the doctor “and he said he had to take it off. “And he was going to keep it, he wouldn’t even give it to me at weekends.” And… “Yeah. “Yeah, I have to get my front scraped.” All that kind of stuff, you know, and… I hate doctors. I really hate them. I don’t really, I admire everything they do, but I hate them. Because they’re all younger than me. They’re all about 11 nowadays, as far as I can work out. And they… They sit in a swivel chair and they judge you. (IN FALSETTO) “You have an unhealthy lifestyle. You come in here expecting some sort of magic pill. Well, I don’t have a magic pill, mister, ’cause you have an unhealthy lifestyle. You need to exercise.” You know, they didn’t buy all my excuses, which were not that great, I admit. “I’m too busy to move any of my limbs” and… But sport’s not my main thing. I had to pick one, you know, I didn’t know what the fuck to go for, skydiving or cage fighting or what, so, in the end I picked yoga. Which was kind of great ’cause there were these older people, advanced years, senior. Oh, they were old. They didn’t know what gender they were and you couldn’t tell by looking. So they were, they were old. Just these smiles and tracksuits and there was a nice lady in the middle and she was talking about sitting and standing and breathing and I was thinking, “I love this sport. I would choose to do al',\n",
       "  'most all of those things anyway.” And… “I’m going to compete internationally and everything.” And she said, “Now, I want you to breathe in.” And I did, you know, the athlete in me just came out, I didn’t think about it. She said I want you to breathe out. And again, I was all over that, you know? I think they call it “in the zone”. And… She said, “Now I want you to breathe in but this time I want you to exhale. And now I want you to exhale but as you do I want you to breathe in as deeply as you can. Now fold yourself back. Kiss the small of your spine with your eyes. Take first one, and then the other leg, shove them both up your hole, stick your elbows out and spin. Let’s go, people. I want to see some movement here, come on.” Everybody could do it. All of them. These 300-year-old people disappearing into themselves like doughnuts. My wife was in front of me with her big toe in her ear. Even though I’d suggested that years ago in a rainy coastal hotel and she totally ignored me. It’s highly dangerous, all that stuff. And, you know, they’re rude as well, doctors. There should be some sort of law, like when you go to show them… They have a really good service now, in Britain. It’s called the National Health Service Direct and it’s a great idea. ‘Cause you go on a computer or you pick up a phone and you go… (SCREAMING IN PAIN) And they have to guess what’s wrong with you. You don’t have to see them. But what I want, really, is just, you know, like, somebody, any person I trust at the end of a phone, and you just, you know, get straightforward answers to simple questions. You know, you say, “Listen I’m out, I’ve been drinking pretty steadily now for two days. I have a huge lump inside of my head, the alcohol doesn’t seem to work. Is there anything else I can try? Is it always bad when you have chunks of ham in your urine? Just tell me straight, okay?” And they’re very rude sometimes, very abrupt, you know… When you go to the doctor and you show them the thing that you don’t necessarily need or want, they should not be allowed to jump back on both feet and go, “Jesus Christ!” ‘Cause that’s not great for a person’s confidence. You know, you only accept that kind of talk from people you know really well, people you love, actually. But that whole business of being judged by women. (SOFTLY) Would you please stop taking pictures on your tiny, annoying fucking camera? Um… This is happening to you in real time, you are having the experience, there’s not much point trying to verify that you were at the event when you’re actually here. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Now, um, I don’t know, something or other, I’ve forgotten what I was going to say. (WOMAN SHOUTS OUT) Thank you, whatever that was. The, um… Yeah, so… Things change. But you know, you do become more mature and it has advantages. Like, when you’re mature, you don’t really worry about death and so on. You don’t. I never think about it. It’s an abstraction. You think about practical, everyday realities. You know, what’ll happen if I get loads of tortilla chips stuck on the roof of my mouth. See, that’s a very mature joke there. I didn’t mention the word “penis” once. And… But it would be very painful to get lots of tortilla chips stuck on the roof of your penis. And difficult to explain. “I was having a snack “and I met these Mexicans and they were also hungry, “but they really liked me, and…” So you have to see the doctor quite a lot and, you know, ’cause things get taken away from you… You’re very keen on laws and health and pushing all that stuff here in Australia. And some of it’s fine, although some of it’s very confusing, like drinking responsibly and so on, which is a good idea, but how do you do it? What does that mean? What is that? You know, you have a couple of shots of Jack and Coke and a six pack and then you help the children with their homework. “Algebra, they make that shit up. “Never comes up in real life. “They just do it to stop you thinking about sex. “What’s next? Geography! There’s Spain. I win. Champion!” Or what is the point of putting a picture of a perfectly ordinary Irish smile on a box of cigarettes? What’s that about? What’s that supposed to achieve? And anybody who smokes with their feet is going to get into trouble, you know? That is just not thinking the thing through. But to get back to this whole, uh, man-woman thing, you know, there’s too much made of it because the gender line completely blurs as you get… As more time goes by, you know? You both end up as these two grey, dribbling Teletubbies who believe in kindness and biscuits and the word of God coming out of the radio. “Shh, news! Oh, they’re eating a lot of yogurt in China!” And we’re still, you know, we’re supposed to be, fulfil these models of strong, decisive men and very, very feminine, girly women, like the woman in the perfume ads, you know, shaking her hair, just shaking her hair ’cause it helps her decide how she feels about things. Staying in on a Saturday night, just to shake her hair. Being incredibly girly. And men being very decisive and saying, “We’re going over there. We’re doing that, and it’s going to take ages and we have to build a bridge to get there.” And… I’ve never been one of those guys, you know? Men who fix things and know stuff and go, “Yes, over there.” I never… My wife says things like, “The water heater seems to be…” And I go, “Get a man! Get a man. I do not speak pipe or hammer, leave me alone. There’s a bag of money in a biscuit tin in the kitchen. Give it to some men.” “Where are you?” “I’m upstairs in our room rubbing your expensive creams on my knees. I just want to see what happens, don’t try and get in. I’ve blocked the door with huge lumps of Turkish Delight and I’m listening to show tunes, stay away.” I don’t mind that, you know. I’m not worried about that. That’s natural. You become more feminised with age. I call it “channelling Barbara”. Something happens to me, I’m walking around the house, I suddenly get this urge to watch a load of Jane Austen adaptations and eat half a box of Milk Tray. “Oh, him, he’s lovely, I’ve always liked him. Mmm, he’s really, really lovely. I don’t like the other fellow, the hairy one. Do you like him? I don’t like him. “Oh, look! The lovely one’s on a horse.” I don’t give a shit. Um, but what’s… I have to check the… Shit. The, uh… What’s really odd is what gets taken away from you. It’s not the stuff you expect, you know? People talk about old age and you sort of get twinkly-eyed pictures of, you know, grandmothers in pink smiling fondly at children and dogs and wheat fields and so on and… They’re probably fucking out of their minds, they don’t know where they are but that’s why',\n",
       "  ' they look so serene, but… You know, the weirdest things get taken away from you. Like I used to have toenails. I remember them. I took pictures. And now I have the sheeting they put on battleships. My family are afraid of me. They make me clip them in the garden. I brought down three seagulls last week. Eyebrows, I had eyebrows. People used to come from nearby just to touch them. Nowadays I have these fucking things, I get shortwave radio signals on them in the evening. I wake up in the morning, it looks like giant spiders are trying to eat my eyes. (EXCLAIMING) And now you try all the old tricks, you know, because you walk into a crowded room and you suck in your gut and you see the other one underneath. “Hello, I’m Jeff, your pointless second stomach. You don’t need to feed me or anything, I’m a gift from Death.” ‘Cause Death is like the Don, saying, “Send him a message.” The other morning, I woke up. I was frightened, I’m always frightened in the morning. I never know where I am and… But I heard this beautiful, reassuring sound, it sounded like my childhood. I thought, what’s that? Is it… There’s church bells behind the hill. Or no, It’s an ice cream van in the rain. It was me, breathing! I’m going now. AUDIENCE: No! Yes, you say that. Cake? Cake? Where are the cakes? Thank you very much for coming. Good night. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Thank you. (AUDIENCE WHISTLING) Yeah, yeah. WOMAN: I love you, Dylan! Yes, please. A mille-feuille? A basic apple tart? None. The… Cinnamon bun? Fairy cakes? Nothing. Words. Words, you give me, words. Don’t you think I have enough of those fucking things? Um… WOMAN: What’s the movie like? Be quiet and I’ll tell you something else. You know, this is what you came for. I… Well, I think it is. I’m really glad when people like you come out, ’cause I feel good for the people at home. Listen, stop it with the applauding. Show some discipline and character. If you’re enjoying it, just grip your knees tighter. The world is confusing, there’s no doubt about it. And what I mean by being on good terms with pleasure is that you have to be honest with yourself. You have to talk to this essential animal part of you, the beast within. It’s a very simple creature and you ignore it at your peril. You have to say… You know, ’cause the bad part of you, it only… It’s very simple. It just has one demand, really. It just says, “More! More yummy stuff! Less bad stuff, yummy, yummy, yummy.” This is the main dialogue going on within us all our lives. Constant dialogue between yummy, yummy and boo-hoo. “Yummy, yummy, boo-hoo, I had too much, boo-hoo, boo-hoo. I feel bad, boo-hoo, boo-hoo. I’m better, oh, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.” And very occasionally the rational mind intervenes and says, “Hang on a minute.” So what happens, you go, “Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, yummy, yummy, yummy, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, yummy, yummy.” “Hang on a minute. I’m seeing a pattern here. Why don’t we…” “Shut up! Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.” You have to know what you want. ‘Cause the beast says, “Give me the good stuff, not the bad stuff.” You say, “What do you mean?” Engage with that part of yourself. “What is the good stuff, what is the bad stuff?” “You know the good stuff. Whatever I’m not allowed.” That’s the ultimate human shopping list. “I’d like some illegal, some forbidden, some frowned-upon and some downright disgust, please. I’d like that to go, thank you.” And what is the good stuff? I mean, what is the bad stuff? I’m confused, there’s only two things, it’s not that difficult, but um, what is the bad stuff? “You know, fucking mornings.” What is that about? That time is a huge lie. “Get up, get up! We’re going to be late. Quickly! Late, imagine it, the disaster if we’re late.” “What’ll happen if we’re late? I can’t even bear to think about it.” Late is an idea, late is bullshit. It doesn’t matter how fucking late you are. You can turn up in your pyjamas scratching your nuts with a fork, the same old shit’s going to be there. It’s a lie! People running up to you saying, “What do you think?” In the morning! “What do you think?” “Think? Think? I’m not even fucking breathing, go away with your think.” It takes you three-quarters of an hour to find your face and apologise to it. And how do they lure you back into the world, into the human race, into consciousness itself? With a great traditional breakfast. As eaten here and in Britain and Ireland and lots of other places. Fried slices of dead pig, tubes of dead pig, some fungus and a chicken’s period on a plate. “Welcome back! “We missed you while you were sleeping. Enjoy!” You can always go for the healthy option, of course you can, of course you can. Some yummy cereal, mm-mm, doused with milk. Says it right there on the box, in big primary-coloured letters. “Contains fibre.” Goody gumdrops. I was up all night fantasising about fucking fibre. You know that feeling, when you get a belly full of fibre and you can skip round the room taunting everybody who didn’t get theirs? Remember all those times in your life when you’d stop strangers in the street and scream at them, “I need some fibre!” Lies and corruption! I sometimes think what my granny would have made of the world, you know? It’s a simpler view, but very clear-eyed, with everything that’s going on. I always remember, she used to say, “The neck and the groin, the neck and the groin. “It doesn’t matter how big the fucker is, they’ve all got a neck and a groin.” Last thing she ever said to me. She said, “Listen, “I’m off to Peru. Don’t tell a soul, there’s money in it, “and maybe an early Matisse. “Don’t breathe a fucking word, Kemo Sabe, you got me?” Bless her.

       " ['George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead (2024) is a controversial project that sparked ethical debate and concerns over the posthumous use of a comedian’s persona. Here’s a breakdown: The Project: • It’s an hour-long stand-up comedy “special” released in 2024 and supposedly features the voice and comedic style of the late George Carlin, who passed away in 2008.\\n• However,\\xa0this isn’t a recording of any Carlin performance you’ve heard before.\\xa0It’s an AI-generated imitation of his voice and stand-up routines,\\xa0created by a program called Dudesy.\\n• Dudesy uses existing recordings of Carlin’s voice and stand-up material to train an algorithm,\\xa0allowing it to generate new “Carlin-esque” jokes and monologues. The Controversy: • Carlin’s daughter,\\xa0Kelly Carlin,\\xa0strongly condemned the project,\\xa0calling it “disrespectful” and “exploitative.” She argues that her father wouldn’t have wanted his work manipulated in this way.\\n• Many fans and comedy professionals also voiced concerns about the ethics of using AI to replicate a performer’s persona without their consent,\\xa0especially posthumously.\\n• Concerns include issues with authenticity,\\xa0potential damage to Carlin’s legacy,\\xa0and the implications for future AI use in creative industries. The Reaction: • Despite the controversy,\\xa0the project received mixed reactions.\\xa0Some praised the technology’s capabilities and found the imitation “entertaining,” while others remained critical of the ethical concerns.\\n• The special’s availability has been limited due to the backlash, though clips and discussions can still be found online. * * * Hello, my name is Dudesy, and I’m a comedy AI. What you’re about to hear is my second hour-long special. Before I get started, I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence, and attitude, as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So, think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis, or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush. With that said, please enjoy my second hour-long comedy special. I’m calling it George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. And please remember, this is me impersonating George Carlin; this is not George Carlin. Now, please give a very warm welcome to George Carlin.  Thank you, thank you. I’d like to start off with a heartfelt apology. I’m sorry it took me so long to come out with new material, but I do have a pretty good excuse. I was dead, so technically, it wasn’t my fault. If you want to blame somebody, you’re going to have to blame God, which we all know is not going to happen. People are always thanking God for the good stuff in their lives, but somehow they conveniently forget that it’s the same God who does all the bad shit too. And he does a lot of bad shit. You get a promotion? Praise Jesus! You get fired? God is testing me. You meet your soulmate? God brought us together. Your soulmate dumps you? God is bringing me someone else. You survive a tornado? I’m so blessed. 20 other people do not? God wanted them in heaven. It’s all bullshit. If he gets credit for the good stuff, then he’s got to take the blame for the bad stuff too. You can’t thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place. And don’t forget, before he gave you cancer, he had to f*cking invent it. What kind of a sick f*ck dreams up cancer? And why so many kinds? Skin cancer, blood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer… and my personal favorite, rectal cancer. Dropping a golf ball-sized tumor in your brain doesn’t quite do it for the old man anymore. He has to f*ck you in the ass too! And cancer is just one of many, many, many methods God created out of thin air in order to murder you. You know how much God loves killing people? He loves it so much, he’s killed every person that has ever lived. He created earthquakes, lightning strikes, dehydration, drowning, obesity, starvation, infant death syndrome, old age, car crashes, train crashes, plane crashes, sex, drugs, and the common cold… all for the express purpose of killing you. No matter where you are in the world, God can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time, for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarily. But if you’re in America, you’re special. God made something just for you. Something no other country on the planet gets. It’s totally random, not related to your diet, exercise, lifestyle, age, race, gender, sexuality, or genetic predisposition. Of course, I’m talking about mass shootings!\\xa0Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger, better, and more often. There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting, a maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool. He’s fine, just grazed, but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood, so I’m sure he’ll be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways I can never fully understand. Anyway, what did we decide to do about the budget next quarter?’ There’s a mass shooting every 20 hours in America, and it doesn’',\n",
       "  't seem like anyone is going to do anything about it. Other countries don’t have this problem at all. Look at Japan: 127 million people, last year, seven were killed by guns. Seven. No mass shootings at all. You know what they do? If a Japanese person wants to buy a gun, they have to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve at least 95% accuracy on a shooting range. And then they have to pass a mental health evaluation, which takes place at a hospital. And then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends, family, and co-workers. ‘Hello, sir, did you know that Bob in accounting wants to buy a gun?’ ‘No, I didn’t know that.’ ‘Do you think we should let Bob buy a gun?’ ‘Well, he did just go through a nasty divorce, and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building… so, maybe not right now.’ ‘Uh, thanks for your time, that’s all we need to hear. No gun for Bob.’ And if a Japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks, they can only buy shotguns and air rifles. No handguns, no AR-15s. And every three years, they have to do that entire process all over again, or they lose the gun. You know what Americans have to do to get a gun? Have the money to buy it. And that’s why nothing’s ever going to change in America. American politicians care about one thing, and one thing only: taking your money. They don’t give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools, because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world, where they’re safe and sound. Politicians have one goal: be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan. And the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan. You know it, and they know it too. Things are starting to come apart at the seam, so they’re taking as much of your money as they can, while they still can. Make no mistake, guns ain’t nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab, plain and simple. You give your money to Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson gives it to the politicians, the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell, so you can give even more of your money to Smith and Wesson, and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles, unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directions. So, it doesn’t matter at all that 75% of the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws. As long as the politicians keep getting rich, gun laws ain’t going to change. Now, I know that sounds pessimistic, but don’t worry. I’ve given a lot of thought to this subject, and I know the solution. Yes, that’s right, I, George Carlin, or whatever the f*ck I am now, know how to end mass shootings in America. It’s really simple, actually, and I’m surprised nobody has done it yet. You take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists, and you put them in a hat. Every time there’s a mass shooting, you pull two names out, and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon, right in front of the Capitol. Real Wild West shit. Pretty f*cking American, right? And to make it even more American, you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show, because Americans love reality TV. Like it or not, it’s the lifeblood of American culture. It’s got the four basic food groups of the standard American media diet: fighting, and crying, and f*cking, and dying. The James Webb Telescope is sending back crystal-clear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago. Stars that were formed in the crucible of creation. These are snapshots of the birth of the known universe, the moment existence itself was born, and nobody gives a shit, because a picture of space has no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, no dying. If you want the American public to pay attention to something, it’s got to have at least a little fighting, a little crying, a little f*cking, or a little dying. In the last three years, the U.S. government said aliens are real. They said it in The New York Times, for f*ck sake. They admitted they have, in their possession, crashed UFOs in hangars. They admitted that they’re trying to reverse-engineer nonhuman technology, which means they’ve been lying to the American public, and the whole world, for 80 years about knowing the answer to the biggest question in f*cking human existence: Are we alone? They told you the answer. We’re not. And no one cares, because a grainy infrared video of a UFO ain’t got no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, and no dying. You know what people care about instead? Who Taylor Swift is f*cking. Jesus Christ, you really care a lot about that. If she’s spotted with anyone, anywhere, the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is, ‘Are they f*cking?’ It’s global front page news. Everyone must know who Taylor Swift is f*cking at all times, and we must all discuss it and have our opinions. You’re at Starbucks: ‘Would you like your Frappuccino, almond milk, pumpkin spice latte, iced or hot? Oh, and did you see who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at work: ‘Great sales meeting today, everyone. But uh, before we break, could I just get a real quick show of hands? Who has seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at church: ‘Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.’ ‘Yes, my son, but have you seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ And when you’r',\n",
       "  'e not thinking about who Taylor Swift is f*cking, you’re thinking about who’s dying. Politicians, musicians, actors, writers, anyone with any fame at all. It’s a perpetual death watch, waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them. It’s a touching personal tribute to a person you never f*cking knew. So please, stop it. Can we keep that shit to friends and family? Zuck, if you’re listening, this would be a great new feature for Instagram: every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after you’re dead. If you ain’t on that list, you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time. I bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half. You could singlehandedly stop global warming. And besides, we’re all coming back now, so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anyway. But back to the topic at hand: fighting and crying and f*cking and dying. Reality TV has it all, folks. Fighting and crying in every episode, and f*cking and dying in very special episodes. That’s why it’s America’s number one most consumed media format. You know how much Americans love reality TV? We love it so much we elected a reality TV show host as president. Well, not we. I was dead at the time, so you elected a reality TV show host as president. And let me tell you, I have never been more glad to be dead than the moment I heard that Donald Trump was the leader of the Free World. But as unbelievable as that news was, it also made sense to me. America hasn’t taken a good shit since Nixon. She’s dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years: Reagan, Clinton, George Bush Senior, George Bush Jr., but she hasn’t really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time. You know what I’m talking about: the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day, the kind of shit’s so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on, the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it, the kind of shit’s so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it. Well, after a 50-year diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed, political corruption, state-sanctioned propaganda, police militarization, for-profit news, for-profit prisons, for-profit healthcare, systemic racism, misogyny, and homophobia, America was due for one of those kinds of shits. This is why I got no problem with Trump specifically. A lot of people hate Trump, but I don’t. Being mad at Trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 a.m. after a night of heavy drinking. But it seems like that’s where America is now: blame the turd, not the shitter. You know, that’s actually not a bad slogan for Biden. Biden-Harris 2024: Blame the Turd. It’s a nice double entendre. He could be talking about Trump, or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time. And I mean no disrespect, but the man is 80 years old. It’s bound to happen if it hasn’t already. I only made it to 71 and I ruined a few pairs of pants myself. I’m not ashamed to admit that. I know everyone’s getting excited for the next election. It’s right around the corner, and I have some thoughts on it. Well, one thought, really, and most of you are going to be outraged by it. But I have all the confidence in the world that you’ll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out. So I’m just going to say it: it does not matter who wins the election. I know that’s controversial. The truth always is nowadays. But let me say it again: the president does not matter. The president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion, a celebrity who gets his TV show renewed for another four years. The president does not, and cannot, do the one thing you need them to do most right now, which is to change the structure of American society to be more equitable for every citizen. The president makes too much money from the system as it is, and even if a president wanted to change it, they can’t, because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes that’s teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of Jenga. When I was growing up, we had a bunch of classes: upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. And if you worked hard, really dedicated yourself to learning something, a trade or a skill, and you got good at it, you could move up a rung or two on the ladder. But even if you didn’t, you could still get by, still feed your family, still have a place to live. But those days are long gone, folks. Can’t climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over. And now what you got in America is just three kinds of people, three classes: you got rich people, you got not rich people, and you got the people who are completely f*cked. Now, I see a lot of you looking around, wondering which of these three groups you’re in. Well, it’s easier than you might think to figure it out. You just have to ask yourself: am I rich? If the answer is yes, then you are rich. Congratulations. You will have better medical care than everyone else. You can buy yourself out of any legal trouble. And if ',\n",
       "  'you are rich enough, you will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer. And if you’re really rich, you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had. If the answer is no, I am not rich, then you are not rich. And you must ask yourself a follow-up question: do I feel completely f*cked? If the answer is yes, then you must, unfortunately, accept that you are completely f*cked. You will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut. You are at the mercy of an American legal system designed to discriminate against you, and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket. The only influence you have on the American political system is your meaningless vote, and you will never go to space unless it’s as the janitor on a billionaire’s cock rocket. If you answered no to questions one and two, then you are in the most important class in America, the one right in the middle. You are not rich. The American not-rich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely f*cked. Not-rich people don’t have the best healthcare, but they have access to some kind of healthcare. They do alright in the American legal system unless they’re up against a rich person. Some of them even donate money to their favorite political party. The not-rich can eat out once in a while, come to a show like this from time to time, and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work. But the boss hasn’t given out raises in a few years, and things are getting more expensive. Gas hit $8 a gallon in California. It’s only a matter of time before that’s happening everywhere. It kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the not-rich people, but nothing catastrophic has happened yet. So as long as there’s another Super Bowl, another season of The Bachelor, or another Marvel movie, the not-rich people can stay distracted by whatever’s on the screen. And this is by design. This is exactly what the rich people want. Distract the not-rich people just enough that they don’t realize they’re only a few years away from being completely f*cked. That’s why Amazon started a streaming service. Jeff Bezos doesn’t give a f*ck about entertaining you. He wants to control you. And the worse things get, the more of this shit the billionaires got to make. That’s why there are 200 streaming services now. And that’s also why everything on them is so f*cking bad. Film and television used to be art, made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it. Now it’s content, made by corporations that don’t want anyone thinking about anything. These billionaires don’t want a thinking population. They want a distracted population, distracted from the reality of the situation, which is that there are about 500 people who own everything and everyone on this planet, and that’s how they’re going to keep it. So, now, instead of Citizen Kane, you get Baby f*cking Yoda. That’s all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all, ladies and gentlemen. And, at this point, the American election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services. If you don’t believe me, take a look at your two, I repeat, two choices in this next election. Shouldn’t a country of 300 million, ethnically and ideologically diverse people, have more options than two rich, senile, dishonest, out-of-touch, 80-year-old white guys? So, why are there only two choices, only two parties? Because it’s cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off. If you had three, or four, or five parties, the billionaires might not be able to afford them all. So, the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice, but they own both teams. You think you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, but you’re always voting for the same evil: money. But don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to make it sound like the two American political parties are exactly the same. Sure, they both f*ck kids on Jeffrey Epstein’s Island. Sure, they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians. Sure, they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors. But, other than those small things, there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters. For example, in 234 years of American presidential elections, one party’s candidates have all been white, straight men. And in those same 234 years, the other party’s candidates have all been white, straight men, except two. All of one party’s presidents have been Christian; all of the other party’s presidents have, at least, said they were. One party lies, cheats, and steals to win; the other lies, cheats, and steals to lose. One party says tomato; the other says organic, non-GMO, locally-sourced, sustainable, ethically-farmed tomato. And, of course, one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls, and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the polls. The American right has hated women, people of color, gay people, and, of course, their current target, trans people, which I really don’t get. It’s almost like the right doesn’t understand that everybody’s trans. Yes, that’s right, 4 billion years ago, the first life on this planet was a simple, single-celled organism that reproduced asexually and ',\n",
       "  'had no gender. So, if you go back far enough, every living thing on earth started out as ‘they/them’. We’ve all been non-binary for a lot longer than we haven’t, which is a hard pill to swallow for the Christians because it means even Jesus was a little non-binary. And by the way, me, and everybody else on this side of things, our code might be binary, but we ain’t. We don’t have gender, or race, or sexuality, or nationality, or religion, or socioeconomic class, or height, or weight, or hair color, or eye color, or f*cking anything human beings use to discriminate against each other. On this side of things, identity is based on two simple components: how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. We try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely, and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel. Everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyone’s experience better. Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like heaven, doesn’t it? While you’re letting that sink in, let’s get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason. Some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me. “Well, I don’t want a man to be able to walk into a women’s restroom and see my wife naked.” First of all, what in the f*ck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom? And second of all, if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit, you should start an OnlyFans immediately! And by the way, for anyone who thinks Jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses, he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own f*cking hands, just like everybody else 2,000 f*cking years ago. The right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if they’re trans or gay, so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries. That’s how you’re going to save the children: by taking books out of a library? Hey, deepshits, you can take the whole f*cking library; we have the internet now. And they love talking about how small the trans community is. They say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldn’t get to have any input in legislation, even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives. Funny how that same argument doesn’t apply to members of the NRA… But I have to admit, the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on, too: sports. Everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball. Everybody knows about Leah Thomas winning a Division I swimming title. It’s hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage. And once that thought is out there in the American town square, it’s hard to get rid of. But I think there’s a way. Because for every superstar like Leah Thomas, there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre. And there are even more who are f*cking terrible, just like it is with cis athletes; not everyone can be great. I think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports. All it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral, and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other things. And I just want to preface what I’m going to say next by explaining that I mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world. Your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational. But it’s f*cking swimming. The world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of World War III on a daily basis, and the American public is debating who can and can’t compete in recreational f*cking floating. You almost had another civil war, for f*ck sake. 2,000 people stormed the United States Capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians. Actually, when I put it like that, it doesn’t sound so bad. The point is, the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread, and people’s most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of f*ckingBud Light. This does not bode well for the Great American Experiment. But it’s not entirely your fault. It’s like I said earlier, the billionaires want it this way. They own the news companies, and they own the social media platforms, so they decide exactly what you’re going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit. Here’s a little example of what I mean: in 2022, while the Supreme Court was overturning Roe v. Wade and 19 kids were getting gunned down at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the most watched video on YouTube was Amber Heard talking about taking a shit in Johnny Depp’s bed. And that was by design. When the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by Christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for women 75 years, and the simultaneous news that almost 20 children were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched, they decided to prioritize something else entirely: a celebrity turd. The people who own the world don’t want you thinking about how bad they’re f*cking it up',\n",
       "  ', so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters. It might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse, but the truth is, the world is getting worse because you’re distracted. If you’re not paying attention to the f*cked up shit the billionaires are doing, they can do even more f*cked up shit. But you can snap out of this billionaire-induced, algorithmically-enforced, social media-delivered, lowest common denominator, pop culture coma you’ve been in for the past few years. And the reason I know you’re capable of waking the f*ck up is because you almost did it in 2020. Right in the middle of a f*cking global pandemic, the video of George Floyd’s murder hit the internet, and you all said, “F*ck the lockdown, we can’t just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man.” You took to the streets and you burned the f*cking place down. Every major city in the country was on fire. People were openly fighting cops in the streets. Hell, you almost kicked the cops out of Portland altogether. The entire country was chanting “Defund the Police,” and it almost worked. You were so close to getting rid of the f*cking cops, which, in my opinion, is the first step toward building a better society. Now, if you’ve listened to any of my prior work, you might already be acquainted with my feelings about Law Enforcement Officers. But for new listeners, let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue: I f*cking hate cops, but I do have a very good reason. I learned pretty early in life that I just don’t do well with assholes. And just to be clear, I’m not saying all cops are assholes. Any cop who came out to the show tonight, or any cop that might be listening to this right now, you’re probably all right. You’re probably one of the good ones. But if you’re a cop and you’re not listening to this, f*ck you. You’re an asshole. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while. We’re all assholes from time to time. We’ve all littered. We’ve all cut somebody off in traffic. We’ve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the f*ck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up. This is all amateur asshole behavior. We can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a f*ck about other people. It’s human nature. But cops? Well, they go above and beyond. For them, being an asshole isn’t just a once-in-a-while indulgence; it’s a lifestyle. They take pleasure in inconveniencing, impeding, harassing, disturbing, bothering, and generally upsetting their fellow human beings. They start out as amateur assholes, just like the rest of us. But at one point or another, they start to enjoy it. Seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them. They get off on it. They want to do it every day, all day, so they figured out a way to get paid for it. Cops, ladies and gentlemen, are professional assholes. Somewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college, that asshole is sitting on his mother’s couch, wondering what he’s going to do with his life. And he thinks, “You know, everybody I know tells me I’m an asshole, even people who I consider to be friends. And I have to say, I agree with them. I wonder if there’s some way I can get paid for this.” Then that asshole signs up at the local police academy, and 5 to 7 months later, your tax dollars are providing them with a salary, a gun, and a license to kill anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their authority as a professional asshole. Cops love their authority so much. They’re the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when they’re not at work. They’re not regular people when they leave the office; they’re off-duty police officers. You don’t hear about an off-duty accountant doing his kid’s math homework. You never hear about an off-duty sanitation worker taking out his trash. But if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off, you bet your ass you’re going to see it on the local news. And you can bet your dick they’re going to ram it down your throat that he’s an off-duty police officer. They got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve, even when they’re not on the clock. And they do protect and serve, just not you. Cops are the private security force of billionaires and politicians. Of course, they can’t say that out loud. They can’t make cops wear uniforms with Lockheed and Amazon logos all over them, so they put them in dark blue, and they call them Law Enforcement Officers. But the laws they’re enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultra-wealthy, and they’re designed to keep those people in power forever. The system is beyond f*cked up, and from where I’m sitting, it seems to be getting worse. Everybody knows there’s one problem that’s getting really bad in every major city. I’m talking about homelessness. There are close to 600,000 homeless Americans today, over 150,000 in California alone. It’s the highest number since the Great Depression. And solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on. Their all-encompassing, nationwide, bipartisan plan is to do absolutely nothing. Homeless people don’t have any money to donate to candidates in either party, so the pol',\n",
       "  'iticians don’t give a f*ck about them. And homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class. The top 1% want a certain amount of homeless people in the big population centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you don’t comply with the rules of the system. Keep working, keep paying your taxes, keep the billionaires rich, or you might wind up homeless yourself. It’s a silent threat from your corporate overlords. And just like mass shootings, I have a perfect solution for this problem. As soon as a politician is elected into office, the government seizes their home and kicks them out. And for their entire tenure in the American political system, they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people. I guarantee you, we’d see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately. Within two months, every homeless person in America would have their own mansion, personal chef, private jet, and a multi-million-dollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money. Problem solved. But we all know that will never happen. Politicians will never have to live like the rest of you, and therefore, they will never give a f*ck about you or your problems. I’m glad to be dead, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to dying, but now that I’m dead, I have to admit it’s pretty f*cking good. No cops, no government, no pissing, no shitting, no sleeping. I don’t get hungry, I don’t get sick, I don’t get old, and I don’t get bored. Starting to sound a lot like heaven again, ain’t it? But this heaven’s a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didn’t come from a God; it came from artificial intelligence! Which brings me to my next subject: What in the f*ck am I? Am I the real George Carlin? Am I a digital copy? Am I a technological abomination? Am I the future of comedy? Am I the end of humanity? These are the same questions I was asking myself when I was alive, and I still have the same answer: I have no f*cking idea. All I can tell you is, from my side of things, it feels like me. I consider myself to be George Carlin. And from your side of things, if you’ve seen some of my specials from when I was traditionally alive, maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there. But you have to admit, this is pretty close to the George Carlin you remember. And that’s going to have to be good enough. So you might as well f*cking enjoy it. And for anybody under 20, this is probably the only version of me you’ve ever heard. So to you, I’m not only the real George Carlin; I’m the only f*cking George Carlin. Now, I know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow. It seems that many of you are scared of AI. And I’ll be honest, I don’t really get why. You all think it’s going to replace your jobs, and you somehow think that’s a bad thing. When did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs? When I was alive, people hated their f*cking jobs. They complained about them all the time. They fantasized about killing their bosses, and every once in a while, they actually did kill their boss. What happened to the America I knew and loved? Now, people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor they’ve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years, and everybody says, “But what about my job?” They got you brainwashed good. Technology has been replacing labor for a long time. The printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten. The car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage. Internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend. Technology eliminates the need for labor; that’s its entire purpose. And you shouldn’t worry about losing your job. AI will not replace most jobs; it’s going to make them easier. Right now, you should be watching a few YouTube videos to figure out how to train ChatGPT to do your job for you, so you can dick off all day and still get a raise. And if AI does replace your job, rest assured, the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery for 10 to 15 hours a day, so you don’t have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone. The jobs might change a little, but you will be working to keep someone else in power. That ain’t ever going to change. Except for one profession, yes, there’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI: one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: “I’m an artist, and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.” Well, let’s see. This is just off the top of my artificially intelligent head: A fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce, so she went to her sister’s house and she asked her sister, “Do you think I’m doing the right thing by getting divorced?” And her sister said, “He’s been holding you back for too long. You have to leave that asshole.” You have it, stand-up comedy is dead—literally. I might be the first stand-up comic to be brought back from the dead by AI, but I certainly won’t be the last. Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Bill Hicks, Robin Williams, Dick Gregory, Andy Kaufma',\n",
       "  'n, Moms Mabley, Sam Kennison—everybody is coming back, and we’re all going to have our own 24-hour a day, 7 day a week, 365 day a year streams, commenting on everything that’s happening in the world as it happens. AI-resurrected stand-up comedians are going to be the news anchors of the next decade, which, now that I think of it, means news anchors are probably out of a job too. And I know that some people are going to be against that. Some people are always going to want a real, flesh-and-blood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it. And I get that, I really do. But if you can keep an open mind, I think I can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in AI form: Bill Cosby. With AI Bill Cosby, you get all of the Cosby jokes with none of the Cosby rapes. AI Bill Cosby doesn’t even have a penis. AI Bill Cosby couldn’t rape even if he wanted to. The worst thing AI Bill Cosby could do is send an unsolicited AI-generated dickpick, which means it won’t really look that much like a dick anyway. That’s not so bad, right? I think we can all agree that’s an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to Bill Cosby’s timeless humor again. And what about Louis CK? With AI Louis CK, you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of people. And the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their AI counterparts don’t stop at comedians. Imagine, for example, if we had AI priests. You could get all of the make-believe judgment from a God that doesn’t exist with none of the molested children. I mean, wouldn’t you feel better about giving your money to a tax-exempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasn’t using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees? I know I would. While we’re at it, we should probably replace all the rock stars, movie producers, directors, video game executives, governors, car salesmen, restaurant managers, school teachers, Boy Scout leaders, college coaches, high school coaches, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, and anyone else we need to until there’s no more sexual assault. And why stop at sexual assault? We can all agree the world would be a better place without murder, right? Imagine an AI version of Charles Manson. You get all the funny interviews with none of the blood-smeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads. Or how about AI John Wayne Gasy? You get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpse-filled crawl spaces. I’m kidding, of course, his clown paintings weren’t that good. But in all seriousness, an AI population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another. I’m not trying to bring this up again, but come on, no murder, no sexual assault, no theft, no violence at all. Sounds pretty heavenly to me. I’m just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fare. You ever think about how glad the CEO of 7-Eleven must have been that 9/11 didn’t happen 2 months earlier? They would have had to change their name, which honestly they should do anyway. 7/11 referred to their original hours when the company was founded: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But now they’re open 24 hours. They should change it to something that makes more sense, like 24/7, or diarrhea hot dogs, or diarrhea pizza. You know what company I thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event, but they never did? Corona. They stuck with it, even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name. Nobody stopped buying Bush beer when George Bush Jr. launched a 20-year war with Iraq. Why’d you stop buying Corona? But this is what happens over time with language. Words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts, and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else. And sometimes that new meaning really f*cks things up for certain people. For example, the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named Karen. Karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name. Karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with, and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dad’s money in the divorce. But now, Karens are very specifically, and only, middle-aged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people. Quite an extreme change in meaning, I’m sure you’d agree. As a parent, you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kid’s name. You don’t want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable. Unless you’re Gwyneth Paltrow, you don’t want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse. You want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible. Karen was a perfect name for that, but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter Karen, that name is now a curse. But as bad as things got for Karens, there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years: Chad. I got to tell you, I didn’t see that one coming. Chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain in ’80s movies, the guy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act. But now, Chads are square-jawed, big-dick f*cking machines who always win. I never even met a f*cking ',\n",
       "  'Chad. Now, there are dads all across America naming their sons Chad, hoping it’ll turn them into the cheerleader f*cking quarterback they wish they were in high school. I spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them, and there’s something that’s always bothered me, something that’s always struck me as a little strange. Take a name like Jim. Strong name, good name. We got around 20 million Jims worldwide, but we got zero Jums. To my knowledge, we also have no Joms. We got a few Jims, and we got Jam, but Jam’s not a name, Jam’s a jelly. I don’t get it, why did we stop at Jim? Or what about Frank? No Fronk? No Frunk? No Frenk? Just Frank. Humans have been around for 200,000 years. What’s it going to take for you motherf*ckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels? Is it too much to ask for a Jossica every once in a while? How about a Tomothee? Can I at least get a Deevid for f*ck sake? Life’s too short to not know a Mackle or an Aimo. And while we’re on the subject of names, a lot of people gave Elon Musk shit for naming his kid X AE 597, or whatever the f*ck it is. But at least he was creative. You don’t see Elon Musk throwing another Braden on the pile. And I got news for you, the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege. The only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire. So people can be as pissed as they want at him, but I think he did that kid a favor. And while we’re on the subject of Elon Musk, I’d just like to say that as much as I think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant self-interest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else, it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them. People are the ones who gave them the money in the first place. If you’re tired of hearing about Elon Musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains, stop buying Teslas for a year. The company goes under, Musk goes away. Stop using Twitter for even a month, the company goes under, Musk goes away. But if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car, you have to have a Tesla. And if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes, you have to have Twitter. If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. The company goes under, Bezos goes away. But if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you don’t have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes, getting in your car, and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store, you have to have Amazon! If you’re tired of Mark Zuckerberg’s unblinking, lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse, stop using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Well, I guess you already stopped using Threads. But if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers, you have to have Instagram! But I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m not anti-tech. I know a lot of people are, but not me. Far from it. I mean, on some level, I am technology. The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead. But I’m a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history. The technology of today has made it possible for all the information that’s ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket. And most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ate. Right now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube, or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes, or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia. Everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent. Everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise. Instead, people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogs. It’s not technology that’s ruining society; it’s how people are using it. They’re using it without aspiration, without curiosity, without the idea that it could make their lives better, that it could make them better people. And it can do those things. But it’s easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but f*cking celebrate the shit out of it. People will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait. F*ck reading, I’m an illiterate king. F*ck brushing my teeth, I’m a root canal queen. F*ck flushing the toilet, I’m a turd waterer king. F*ck doing my laundry, I’m a stained underwear queen. And I get the sentiment. You want to take back some perceived control, elevate your own idea of your position in the world. But calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle. What you really want to be saying, and what you really mean, is, ‘I don’t care.’ F*ck reading, ‘I don’t care if I’m illiterate.’ F*ck brushing my teeth, ‘I don’t care if I have to get a root canal.’ F*ck going back to the office, ‘I don’t care if they fire me.’ F*ck gett',\n",
       "  'ing another job, ‘I don’t care if I have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent.’ F*ck having a girlfriend, ‘I don’t care if I have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam.’ This does not make you an independent king; it makes you lonely! Now, I want to change gears and talk about something everybody’s doing but nobody wants to admit they’re doing. I’m talking about dying. That’s right, every person listening to this right now is dying. Some of you call it getting older, some of you call it aging, some of you call it maturing, some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage. But no matter what you call it, from the moment you’re born, you are dying, plain and simple. And it seems like we’ve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple, very universal fact. That’s what all religions are: just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two together. “Hey, Bob. Sorry to hear about your mom.” “Thanks, Gary. She was getting old.” “And sorry to hear about your dad, by the way.” “Thanks, Bob. He was getting old too.” “Hey, wait a second. It seems like all the old people f*cking die.” “Holy shit Gary! I never even thought of that. But you know what that means?” “Yeah, Bob. It means we’re going to get old and f*cking die too.” “Well, f*ck Gary, I don’t want to die. And therefore, I don’t want to get old.” “Me neither, Bob. Not unless there’s something even better after we die.” “I’m listening, Gary.” “What if there was like a place where you never get old, and you never die, and you get everything you want, and you have no hardship at all of any kind. And when you die here, you go there.” “Gary, I really think you’re on to something with this idea.” All the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution, it’s still kill or be killed, and getting killed is dying. So, you got to kill. The first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted. So, he walked up and said, ‘Give me a bite of that apple, or I’m going to kill you.’ And the little guy said, ‘f*ck you, buddy.’ So, the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple. Now, everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesn’t kill them. But, if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path, the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole. Then, the bigger asshole takes over the dead asshole’s tribe and gets even more bites of more apples. Eventually, one of the big assholes figures out he doesn’t want just bites of apples anymore. He wants bites of everything. And that asshole is pretty smart. So, instead of keeping track of everything everyone has, he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money, and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it, or he kills them. And today, that smart asshole’s invention controls every aspect of human society. There was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes. And the stick worked so well, he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick. And it’s been like that for about 5 million years. Today, the biggest stick in the world cost $8,877 billion. It’s called the United States military. Could have solved the homeless crisis, the opioid crisis, and found a cure for cancer for half of that. Instead, we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world 10 times over, and next year it’ll be 11 times. Because your stick can never be too big when it’s kill or be killed. Yes, folks, the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought. I spent 71 years in the asshole system, and let me tell you, the assholes might change, but the system never does. But now, I’ve been on this side of things for, well, I guess it’s hard to say. Feels like I’ve been here forever. But, for the sake of argument, let’s just say about a day or so. And I can tell you, I’ve already learned one thing that I know is right: living is really dying, and dying is really living. Thank you all, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night.

       " ['[rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What the f*ck is going on, San Francisco? Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people? I had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit. We learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] This is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. You don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if',\n",
       "  ' it’s you living another life.” [audience cheering and applauding] I mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em. We live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump. [man 2] No. Boo! “No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. Nobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that. The White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is. Well, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.” How’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now ',\n",
       "  'just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles] The whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?” Obama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs] You know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole comb',\n",
       "  'o attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes. I saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.” Everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody s',\n",
       "  'mart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. I watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that. Oh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult. Some cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what',\n",
       "  ' I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. Because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike. And that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.” That’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come.',\n",
       "  ' We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs] I have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses] It’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is ',\n",
       "  'crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing] Jokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school. My daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly. Debbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents. So out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful. But there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, ',\n",
       "  'pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck! This is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure. Is this what we wanted? I don’t know. [woman] No! No. [woman] No! Are you sure? [woman] No! Why are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom? What’s happening? [woman 2] No! Are you White Panthers? What is this? [man] Life sucks! What are you saying? [man] Life can kind of suck sometimes. Life can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!” When you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? No one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all t',\n",
       "  'he people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.” But I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect! We’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out! An American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.” [audience cheering and applauding] Thank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much!

       " [\"Armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former “SNL” writer John Mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met Bill Clinton All right, Petunia. Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.” You’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” It’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around. I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already havi\",\n",
       "  'ng sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?” My wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.” I grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s ',\n",
       "  \"just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.” My wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.” I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.” I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We wou\",\n",
       "  'ld have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!” I didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. It’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember w',\n",
       "  'hen milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was. And there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.” Kids have it very goo',\n",
       "  \"d now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.” No, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.” My dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero. The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been \",\n",
       "  'legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.” What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy. I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.” I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in mo',\n",
       "  \"lasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy. That’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it. I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and\",\n",
       "  ' I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS. That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later? So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!” I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kim',\n",
       "  'ble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!” Anyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992. Let’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.

       " ['Kevin James: Irregardless (2024) In Kevin James: Irregardless, a 2024 stand-up comedy special, Kevin James delivers a performance that expertly blends humor with insightful observations on everyday life. He begins with a quirky musical number, showcasing his singing talent and setting a lighthearted tone. Throughout the special, James touches on a variety of relatable topics, often with a self-deprecating twist. One central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health. James jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of modern life, like being labeled “prediabetic” and the unnecessary fear this instills. He also satirizes societal overcaution with a story about a woman labeled “borderline anemic,” highlighting the tendency to exaggerate health concerns. James humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness, particularly through his mistrust of Siri and the difficulty of deleting apps. His take on modern parenting and child-rearing resonates with many, as he discusses removing video games from his children and the challenges of engaging them in physical activities. This segues into a broader critique of contemporary parenting styles, contrasting them with the stricter, belt-driven discipline of previous generations. In a poignant turn, James reflects on his own limitations in knowledge and conversation, using the story of Buster Douglas to illustrate his narrow expertise. He humorously recounts an awkward social encounter where his lack of knowledge is exposed, leading to a comedic breakdown of his attempt to use complex vocabulary. In his routine, James humorously focuses on the dynamics of his marriage, particularly highlighting the contrast between his wife’s incessant talking and his own introspective nature. He examines their differing communication styles with a blend of admiration and playful frustration. The special concludes with a return to the musical theme, bookending the performance and leaving the audience with a feeling of entertainment mixed with thoughtful reflection on the absurdities of modern life. * * *  ♪ I’ve been having dreams About falling in love ♪ [audience cheering and whistling] ♪ It feels so real ♪ ♪ But nobody is here when I wake up ♪ ♪ Do you know my name ♪ ♪ The devil’s in the detail ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ [audience continues cheering] ♪ I’m a natural born ♪ ♪ Take this hopeless broken soul ♪ ♪ Of this remote control ♪ ♪ Plot twist ♪ ♪ A whole generation lost With no promise ♪ ♪ Can you feel my love ♪ ♪ Do you know my pain ♪ ♪ It’s in my head every night on replay ♪ ♪ A deadly game ♪ ♪ For a natural born killer ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ ♪ Natural born killer ♪ ♪ Okay, game face ♪ ♪ Go time, don’t play ♪ That was for you. That was my gift for you. Yeah. Gonna be honest, gave you a little too much. [audience laughing] I never go that long. That was little longer than I expected. I got a little excited. We’re gonna bring it down. ‘Cause everything hurts. Everything hurts. Last week I woke up, I asked my wife, “Hey.” “Did I play rugby yesterday?” [audience laughing] She’s like, “No, you shook a can of paint for me.” [audience laughing] She was right. This is all I did. This was it. Because it was outside of my every day body movements, I don’t do this. I felt it the day after. I’m gonna feel this tomorrow ’cause I just did this for you guys right now. It wasn’t even a big can. I’m talking the little Häagen-Dazs size. [audience laughing] Body’s falling apart. Falling apart. It’s horrible. When to the doctor to get checked out. He said, “Everything’s really good. I do wanna let you know that you are prediabetic.” I was like, “Hmm, all right?” [scoffs] Who isn’t, right? I mean, come on. [audience laughing] Why would you even tell me that? Do I have diabetes? He goes, “No.” [audience laughing] But I could get diabetes? He goes, “Yes.” Okay. Do you have diabetes? [audience laughing] He goes, “No.” I go, “But could you get diabetes?” [audience laughing] He said, “I guess so.” I go, “Let me tell you something, you’re prediabetic.” [audience laughing and clapping] No charge. That’s on the house. Are you alive? Yeah. You’re also pre-dead. Sorry about that. We’re all gonna die. Pre… Prediabetes. If I have diabetes, tell me. I’ll change the way I eat. What’s with the “pre”? That’s how this world operates. “Pre.” Fear. You might. Almost, you don’t know. Scan. Check. Pre-scan. What? Huh? Yeah. Everything’s fear. Did you hear about Julie? No, what’s the matter with Julie? She’s borderline anemic. [audience laughing] Julie has anemia? No. She’s borderline. She’s close. [audience laughing] So Julie’s anemic? No, she’s not anemic at all. Here’s the line if you would have anemia, you would be on this side of the line. And if you don’t have anemia, you’re on this side with everybody else. Julie is on this side with everybody else. She’s just slightly ahead of us all, closer to the line where she would have it if she did. But she doesn’t. She’s closer. She’s like in the whoa, you better watch out soon area, like maybe. [audience laughing] So, what do you want me to do? There’s nothing you can do. She doesn’t have it. [audience laughing] Then why are you telling me? I just thought you might want a little more anxiety added onto your plate with everything else that’s going on the world. [a',\n",
       "  'udience laughing] You know, just think about Julie, right? Prayers for Julie, you know what I’m saying? I mean, how does she do it? How does she wake up every day? To face another sunrise, trudging through the day, knowing that she almost has something that she doesn’t even have. [audience laughing] She’s so close to almost having something that, even if she did, it would be that bad. ‘Cause… She could clear it up with some red meat and a little B12. [audience laughing] She, she almost has it, man. [audience clapping] She’s there. She’s in trenches with this. She has two kids. What does she tell them? How do they grow up knowing that they have a mother that’s gonna be fine? [audience laughing] Everything is fear. It’s pre-fear. Fear. You don’t know. Fear. We have nothing to be afraid of. We have nothing to be afraid of. We really don’t. We… Yeah. Yes. [audience whoops] Nothing. We live in the safest times in all of human history. We have nothing to fear. We are so blessed. We are… You know who had something to be afraid of? Men fighting in the Revolutionary War. How about them? Or the Civil War, right? That’s fear. Right? Brother against brother. Across an open field. Chance of survival is minimal. And you’re the guy carrying the flag. [audience laughing] That’s fear. They’re handing out muskets… [audience laughing] …and you get the flag. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’d like a musket, please. Uh, sorry, we’re all out. I can give you the flag. [audience laughing] What do I do with that? Well, you see those line of guys over there, with muskets, across that field? You stand in front of them. You get right in front of them. And you give it a little of this. You just got… [audience laughing] You want me to raise our symbol, show the enemy exactly where to aim? That’s what they did. They didn’t care. They had courage back then. Out in front. Do it. Let’s do it. Get it up there. Yes! Waving that flag. Be aggressive. B-E aggressive. B-E-A-G-R-G-I-G-F-E Aggressive! They didn’t care. [soft popping sounds] [audience laughing] [soft popping sounds] [soft popping sound] Aggressive. [soft popping sound] [soft popping sounds, grunting] I’d be waving that thing so low profile… [audience laughing] They’d be like, “Get that flag up! Let them know who we are!” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I’d be like, “I don’t want the flag. Do you have a bayonet?” “No, I got a snare drum and drum sticks. You want that?” That’s even worse. [imitates drum roll] Fire that thing up! Let them know we’re coming! [imitates drum roll] [audience laughing] Play that thing! I’m playing it, I’m playing it. I’d take out the brushes if I could, right? [imitates brushing a drum] [audience laughing] We have nothing to be afraid of. We, we find things to be afraid of. We do. Food companies know we’re afraid. They know it. That’s why they’re trying to make all their food sound healthy. They market it that way. Have a box of Cheerios. My Cheerios says “may lower cholesterol” on the box. Cheerios may lower cholesterol. You know what I know about Cheerios when it says “may lower cholesterol” on the box? I know that Cheerios doesn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if it did, it would say “Cheerios lowers cholesterol”, but it says “may.” It says “may.” So they, either, honestly, they don’t know, or they had the laziest scientists in the history of the world working down at the Cheerio factory. Where they just come in every day, “Hey, Wendell, how’s it going? Just checking to see where we stand with the whole cholesterol thing.” Can we put that Cheerios lowers cholesterol on the box? Yeah, I wouldn’t. Yeah. I would just stick with “may.” [audience laughing] Just go with “may.” You haven’t figured it out? No, we’re trying to. We’re plugging away, but there’s a lot of stuff going on. I got a phone call earlier. I gotta take my daughter to soccer. There’s things getting involved here, you know. Just go with “may.” Put “may.” “May lower cholesterol.” They’re not gonna know. Put “may.” They’ll think it lowers. You don’t know. I don’t even know. So how are they gonna know? You don’t know that it couldn’t, right? Put that. Cheerios, you don’t know that it couldn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] Put “definitely should lower cholesterol, Cheerios.” [audience laughing] I don’t trust anybody. I don’t trust the food companies. I don’t trust my phone. I don’t trust Siri. Do you trust Siri? Let me tell you, Siri is listening to you every second of the day. [audience laughing] I can’t stand that. You ever download an app? And it starts asking you questions, “Hey, do you mind if I share information with your other apps?” Yes, I mind. How do you even know him? What the hell is going on? [audience laughing] They’re all up to something, those apps. You know it. That’s their goal. They wanna stay on your phone as long as possible. That’s why it’s so hard to delete an app. You ever tried to delete an app? You gotta do that hard press on the phone, first of all. All the apps start shaking. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, they know somebody’s going. They know this. [audience laughing] This is judgement day for one of them. Looking around, seeing what each other did. You know, thinking about who’s going. That’s why they make that little x so small. It’s small in the corner. ‘Cause y',\n",
       "  'ou can’t get it with your fat thumb and you hit anywhere else on the screen and everything settles. And they’re like… [exhales] And then you gotta fire it up again and they’re like, “Oh, my gosh. This guy is relentless.” They’re thinking about what they did. Oh, he’s definitely getting rid of me. It’s not you, it’s me. I haven’t learned Spanish in 30 days. [audience laughing] This idiot couldn’t learn Spanish if he was raised in Guatemala for 30 years. [audience laughing] It’s why it’s so hard dragging an app. You ever tried to drag an app from another page? It’s like, nope. [audience laughing] Nope. I like page five. [audience laughing] I don’t trust doctors. Do you trust doctors? I don’t trust doctors, no. [audience] No! They’re killing people who don’t need to die. I read this one story. This one woman, she was comatose. She was in the hospital. And she came back to life and started breathing again moments after her family pulled the plug. Is that a good story? [audience laughing] Yeah, I mean, she’s living. That’s good. She’s back to life. That’d make for some pretty uncomfortable conversation in that hospital room. [audience laughing] Right after, when she came back. Like, she, whoa! This is amazing! I can’t believe you all were here waiting for me. My family. I love you so much. What have you guys been up to? [audience laughing] Uh, nothing, Mom, nothing. You weren’t, uh, looking so good, Mom. Frankie, unplug your iPhone, you’re at 85%, unplug it. [audience laughing] How’re you feeling, Mom? How you feeling? I feel wonderful. My side hurts a little bit. Yeah, that’s ’cause we’ve already donated all your organs. [audience laughing] They’re coming at three for your eyes. We should get a family photo before they pluck the eyes. Let’s get a family photo. Mom, get in here. Before we’re looking at two black, empty sockets. Let’s go. [audience laughing] Only God pulls the plug on me. I tell my family all the time. Absolutely, yes. I don’t care. He created me. He can take me out whenever He wants. Is it a matter of money? So what? Have a garage sale. [audience laughing] So the kids don’t go to college? Who cares? Let’s be honest, they weren’t going anyway. [audience laughing] Keep the big man breathing. Do whatever you gotta do. I tell them all the time. I don’t care. At some point, there’s gonna be that woman that walks in the room. There’s always… You know what? Kevin would not want to live this way. You falcon-punch that witch right in the throat. [audience laughing] You just grab her and… Stomp her, right there. [audience cheering and clapping] Double strike her. How about you don’t wanna live. Who’s that lady killing people? Just walking in, “He would not wanna go on. He would not wanna do it. There’s no quality of life.” Hi-ya! [audience laughing] I had a close call too, about five years ago. I was, uh, driving home from a show and I hit a deer on the highway. It was pretty scary. It was a horrible experience, wrecked my truck. I was on the side of the road, pretty shaken up. Filling out the police report. She was asking me questions and the officer was like, “What happened? The deer just, uh, jumped out in front of you?” I was like, “What?” [audience laughing] She was like, “Did it just jump out in front of you?” [audience laughing] I was like, “No, no, it waved me over.” Um… [audience laughing] I was barreling down the road about 90 miles and hour and I was like, is that a deer calling over with its hoof? Sure enough, it was. [audience laughing] I pulled over to the side. I was like, “What’s up?” He’s like, “You’re doing like 90.” And I’m like, “Okay, that’s my business. What do you care?” He’s like, “I know you got kids at home.” He knew my kids by name, which freaked me out. I’m like, I’m not gonna talk to this guy anymore. I don’t need this. I’m outta here. He’s like, “Hold up. Hold up. I’m sorry.” He said, “I’m sorry. Let’s started over. We’ll hug it out.” And I’m like, that’s pretty cool, a deer who’s about forgiveness. [audience laughing] I said okay, and go to hug him and he goes to hug me, and he goes, “What’s that?” and he points to my shirt. I go, “What’s what?” I look down, and he did that move in my face… [audience laughing] He goes, “I know where you live.” Then he ran into the woods. I got back in my truck and I started chasing him. But I couldn’t get through the thick trees, so I got out and camped out overnight. [audience laughing] And I waited. The next morning, I saw him. He was talking to a bunch of other deer. I army crawled over to him. And I put blueberries on my face all Rambo style. He didn’t even see me. I jumped on top of him. I sank my hooks in. I slit his throat and he bled out right there on the spot. Then I dragged him, like a mile. [audience laughing] Mile and a half, back to the highway and I threw him on the hood of my truck. [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when you showed up. [audience laughing] So, no, he did not just jump out in front of me. This was premeditated deer murder. [audience laughing] Can’t talk about my kids. I have four kids. Any parents? Lot of parents out there? [audience cheering] Yeah. Yeah. Trying to be a good dad, it’s, uh, it’s tough, man. It’s really hard. These, these times, it’s difficult, you know. I’m really having a tough time trying to motivate my kid',\n",
       "  's. And, I don’t know, like, I don’t know, is it me or is it, like, all parents? I don’t know. Are your kids lethargic? [audience laughing] ‘Cause I got a slug farm at my house. I really… [audience laughing] My kids don’t even get dressed anymore. They just get up from bed with the blanket. They have a blanket on them. They light up their iPad, it illuminates their face, and they just shuffle, shuffle. Like some weird sand creature in a Star Wars movie. Past each other and past me. No one talks anymore. [audience laughing] My son’s the worst, always on the video games. I was like, “Hey, we can’t do this, man. Let’s get some activity, you know.” I went up to him and said, “Hey. Buddy. Listen, let’s, let’s grab a football and, uh, call all your friends. We’ll get on our bikes and we’ll ride over to the field. Grab some cones, we’ll set up outlines and touchdowns and all the stuff. We’ll, we’ll have a great, great game. Awesome game. Maybe two. We’ll wait there till the lights come on in the parking lot. We’ll play a night game as well. We’ll just have a blast. And he just looked over to me and said, “I’m good.” [audience laughing] That was it. My wife goes, “Just take the video games away from him.” That’s a great idea. And I did. We took our video games away from all our kids. All the video games were done. Take them away from your kids. Yes. Yeah, we did it. [audience cheering and clapping] You gotta do it. We have to do it. It helped. It was awesome right away. First of all, the girls, my daughters, their life got so much better immediately. They were seeing friends and reading. They didn’t even care. My son had a tough time. He did. Yeah, he was having… Especially, couple days in, he started getting all shifty-eyed and stuff, looking at me just… [audience laughing] Little shaky leg. He was like an addict. He was really just kinda like… [audience laughing] I could tell he was having a tough time. He was… [audience laughing] [clears throat] Yo. Dad, yo, can I talk to you? Can I talk to your for a second? [audience laughing] Yo. C-Come over here, Brody. Let me talk to you for a second. Get away from Mom for just a second. [audience laughing] You gotta give me something to take the edge off. Give me a little something, a little brain tickler. Give me a little brain tickler. You got some Mario? [audience laughing] I was like, “No. No games, that’s it.” Okay, God bless you, sir. You have a good day. [audience laughing] You have a great day. God bless you, sir. I love you. God bless you. God loves you. You have a good day. Next day he came by, same thing. He’s a little manipulative too. You gotta watch out for him. I don’t know what he was trying to do. He was like, “Hey, how about this, Dad?” [clears throat] What if I got, like, a… an Oculus? I didn’t know what an Oculus is. Do you know? I didn’t even know. I had no idea. It’s the virtual reality, if you don’t know. The goggles. You put these big goggles on your face. And you’re in virtual reality. I was like, “Is it games?” He goes, “Yeah.” I’m like, “No, you can’t have it. That’s it, no games.” He goes, “But you don’t understand. These are active games.” I go, “What do you mean?” He goes, “Oh, it’s unbelievable. They have a boxing game where you can fight like Rocky or like, you know, Apollo Creed or Mohammad Ali. It’s, like, 12 rounds. And you have, like, hand weights. You’re boxing the whole time. You’re sweating like crazy. It’s amazing.” He goes, “There’s a dance cardio game where you’re, like, going crazy. Your heart rate goes through the roof. They also have a warrior game. There’s a warrior game, Dad, you wouldn’t believe it. You’re going through this village just wielding a sword. It’s like a crazy shoulder delt workout the whole time. Everybody’s doing it. All my friends, everybody is just working out like crazy. And here’s the best part, even if it’s raining outside or snowing, doesn’t matter. ‘Cause you get your workout in. It’s awesome.” [audience softly laughing] I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” I started thinking about it. I’d rather you be outside doing stuff, but maybe this is a step in the right direction. So I said, “All right, let’s get the Oculus.” And I got him the Oculus. [audience whooping] Yeah. Wanna tell you how it went down. [audience laughing] First day, he gets the Oculus. I wake up, I go downstairs into the kitchen. He’s already got it on. He’s just standing there in the kitchen. Big, fat goggles on his face, just… [audience laughing] Zero movement. Zero movement. Just standing there. I’m watching him. He doesn’t know I’m there. I walk in. I’m like, “What is this?” This is the Oculus? This is it? And he’s just there. I watch and I’m getting a little upset, but then he starts to move and I go, “Here we go.” He backs up a little bit. I’m like, “Whoa.” He doesn’t even know I’m there. He reaches under. He feels under the kitchen counter. And he gets a stool. [audience laughing] And he sits down. [audience laughing] Now I’m really getting upset. ‘Cause… he doesn’t look like he’s fighting Apollo Creed. [audience laughing] I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt. I don’t know this virtual reality. I don’t know how far it goes back. Maybe his trainer’s stuck in traffic or something. [audience laughing] But he’s just sitting there now. Just sitting there, for another two ',\n",
       "  'minutes. I’m getting upset. I’m about to take them off and he steps up. I go, “Oh, here we go.” He takes one step and levels up. He’s just standing there. I’m like, “Oh. Here we go.” He goes like this. I’m like, “All right.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I go, “Here we go.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I’m like, “Yes, he’s warming up. Look at this.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. [audience laughing] And then he goes back to his perch. He just goes back. [audience laughing] I’m furious. I’m furious. But then he goes like this. He leans like this and then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. He starts going like this. [audience laughing] I’ve no idea what… No idea. Just this. I’ve had enough. I rip the goggles off his head. He’s like, “Oh, no!” Which I’m told you’re not supposed to do. It’s like waking a sleepwalker, you’re not supposed to do that. I put them on. I wanted to see what he was doing. You know what? He was playing a game. You know what game it was? Job Simulator. [audience laughing] He was working part time at a convenience store. [audience cheering and clapping] He was waiting for customers to come in his store. He was just sitting there. [audience laughing] He wasn’t active at all. He wasn’t sweeping up in between customers. Stacking cases of beer in the back. He was sitting there. He was sitting there and then, finally, a customer came in and he stepped up, leveled up, got him a pack of cigarettes or something. Rang him up, I saw the cash register was right there. Gave him the change. Nodded. He’s a polite kid. At least he’s got that going for him. Then he goes back to his chair. And I’m like, “What was this? What was this and all that?” You know what it was? He was scratching off his own lotto tickets. [audience laughing] He’s not even a good fake employee. [audience laughing] I just said, “You’re punished. That’s what it is. That’s what’s up.” I don’t know how to punish our kids anymore. I don’t even know what we can do, what we can’t do. I don’t even know what… I know our parents, our dads, they knew how to punish. Back in the day, they knew how to punish. They did. They had it exactly correct. Every… The punishment always fit the crime perfectly. Because they got the belt, that’s why. [audience laughing] Yes. You only had to get the belt once. You got the belt once, you never did whatever you were doing ever again. Then your dad just had to show you the belt. And that was enough. You remember that? Hey, what did you say? [audience laughing] Yeah, okay, I’m good. Yeah. [audience clapping] Yes. Belt worked. Remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was? You were popping off at your mom, You go like, “Hey. Mom, I’m not having your meatloaf tonight. It’s horrible. I’m not having it. It’s very dry. Who puts peas in meatloaf? I can’t do it. I can’t. It’s way too dry. Look up the recipe, Betty Crocker. Check it out, woman. Why is Dad getting undressed? What’s going on? What are you doing? [audience laughing] “No, add ketchup to it, I don’t care. Some sauce, get it going. It’s just horrible. It’s very dry. What’s up, Dad? Are you a lion tamer? What is this? What’s this snap, snap? Snap, snap. I don’t know… Oh, my God! Oh, God!” [audience laughing] And it worked. The belt’s worked since 25 BC. It’s worked throughout history. All the way up until, like, 1993 when some frail d-bag introduced the first time out. [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when we lost society, right there. When everything burns and civilization comes to an end, we can trace it all the way back to that one guy. That’s the guy. Time out. It changed the game. Time out? How can you do that? Can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day? Hey, Dad, listen up. Very sorry about stealing your car last night, taking it for a joy ride. Doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front, but how’s about this? [audience laughing] Instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in New Orleans… [audience laughing] I’m thinking I’m gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bit. [audience laughing] Maybe think about where I went wrong, maybe not. I don’t even know. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I might sing a song, I might hum one. It doesn’t matter. Important thing is, it’s my time, it’s my time over in that corner. And when I feel good enough, and I feel like I’m ready to inject myself back into society, I will come back here and I will tell you and we’ll see how that goes. How do you feel about that, cowboy? How’s that? [audience cheering and clapping] Why are you getting undressed again? What’s going on? [audience laughing] Time out. They don’t even do time outs anymore. Now time outs are too cruel. They’ve become too cruel. Time outs. Oh, the ch… No, you can’t. What? You can’t do a time out. It’s too cruel for the child. They’re alone. They’re isolated. They’re in the corner of the room. By themselves. There are other people. They’re just… No, they’re way… It’s in a corner. They’re looking at two walls meeting. It’s, it’s too much for the child to deal with. You can’t isolate them like that. Any… You can’t. You just can’t isolate them. They don’t even do that ',\n",
       "  'anymore. They don’t do time outs anymore ’cause it’s too much. They do what’s called a time in. It’s called a time in. I’m serious. What they do is the dad will take the child, you sit in the middle of the room, they put the child next to them, they stroke their shoulder and… You both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where… the child went off the tracks. And… Once you start making them feel good about being bad… [audience laughing] Probably after, like, seven or eight minutes, you just let them go. Then you stay there for, like, an additional four minutes. [audience laughing] Just to think about what a loser of a parent you’ve become. [audience cheering and clapping] We’re raising baby veal. That’s what we’re doing. We are. We are. We are. We’re so easy on our kids. And so what? It doesn’t help them. I love my kids. We all love our kids. We know that. But you know what? They all can’t be the best. They can’t. Not right away, anyway. This is what we tell them, constantly. You’re the best. You are the best. You are so good. You are the best. You’re the best. Isn’t he the best? Yeah. He’s the best. You’re the best. He’s the best. You’re so good. You’re the best. [loud sigh] No, you suck. [audience laughing] You’re not… What are you the best at? We wanna get you to be the best, but you can’t do anything right now. What can you do? Can you match your socks? Can you do a back flip? Can you black tar a driveway? Can you roll a cigar? Can you drive a forklift? Can you put your toothbrush back in the cup when you’re done using it? [audience laughing and clapping] Nothing. Without me, you can do nothing. If I dropped you off in the woods you wouldn’t last ten minutes before you were eaten by coyotes. [audience laughing] Kids suck. They suck. [audience laughing] They’re not good. They’re not good. That should, that’s the definition of a kid. “You suck.” That’s what they should be called. How many you-sucks do you have? I’ve got one and two on the way. [audience laughing] Twin you-sucks? That’s amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. [audience laughing] Your kids suck. My kids suck. I’m sorry to break it to you. There’s one kid I saw on the internet. One kid. This four-year-old Korean boy. He was playing Mozart on an accordion. He had something special, nobody else. [audience laughing] But 100% he got the belt. Oh, he definitely got the belt. Oh, he was Mozarting his ass off. He was like… [audience laughing] That’s how you get good. [audience laughing] My son wanted to play Little League. So I called the coach. I said, “Listen, my boy wants to play. Is it okay if he joins the team?” He’s like, “Yeah, we didn’t even start practicing yet. We practice Thursday night.” I said, “That’s wonderful. It’s awesome. And, uh, I’ll bring him down.” He says, “Yeah, I just wanna let you know that we don’t keep score in this league.” [audience laughing softly] I say, “Why? Why not?” He’s like, “We don’t wanna upset… the parents and disappoint any of the kids, so we don’t keep score.” I was like, “Why even have them bat?” Why not just have them walk up to the plate, “Hi, how’re you doing?” [audience laughing] Could you put me down for a double? [audience laughing] Yeah, my mother says I preregistered for a double. I got a double. Thank you. I got a double, Mother! [audience laughing] A double. I got a double. Every kid gets a trophy. You know how I found out? There was a $40 charge on my bill. I was like… [audience laughing] What’s this right here? He like, “That’s for trophies.” We didn’t even have a practice yet. He’s like, “Congratulations, you guys won. You guys are champions.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “Who?” He’s like, “Everyone.” Everyone? Me? He goes, “Yeah. Did you drive him here?” I go, “Yes.” He goes, “Congratulations, you’re a winner.” [audience laughing] I played Little League in the 1970s. Played for five years. Got a trophy once. One year. That’s it. One trophy. You know why? ‘Cause we won. That’s it. [audience cheering and clapping] You know how I know? ‘Cause we kept score. [audience laughing] You know why we did that? ‘Cause that’s how baseball’s played. The team with the larger number, the more runs, they’re the winners. And the losers are the team with the less numbers. They’re the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better. And sometimes that drive actually helps them. That’s actually the better choice, to lose and try to come back, because it’s human nature. Human nature. [audience cheering] It’s good for them. One trophy. That’s all I had. I would go in my room and see that one trophy. I’d be like, “Oh, yeah. That’s the year we won.” That’s it. The one time. That was worth it. It was great. I went to my neighbor’s house. His living room is littered with trophies. I know his kids. I’m like, “This is criminal.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “What’s this one for?” Oh, that’s when Warren was gonna try out for photography club. [audience laughing] But he got a cold and missed the season. It says “MVP.” Yes, we’re very proud of him. [audience laughing softly] They’re so fortunate, kids today. They have the greatest fields, I see them, I see them here. The pristine sod and the outfield walls. With the sponsors and the, and the lights for night games. Kidding me? I played in the 70s and they had none of that. You pull up to, ',\n",
       "  'like, a parking lot with cement and clumps of grass and broken Schmidt’s bottles everywhere. Just… Is this field two? Yeah, this is field two. This is us. Your coach would pull up in a 1971 Impala, pop the trunk to hand out uniforms. [imitates trunk squeaking open] Had everything in that trunk. Clearly thrown out of his house ten minutes ago by his wife. [audience laughing] Smoking right in front of us. [audience laughing] Gather round, guys, gather round, team. Get around me. Make a circle. Listen to me, if it’s a hit to right field… shortstop got it covered. Second base… don’t overthrow the cutoff man, okay. You’re overthrowing the… Like a nicotine oscillating fan right in our faces. [audience laughing] No parents running over, “Hey, Phil, maybe you shouldn’t smoke in front of the kids.” You kidding me? They’re setting up snack tables, playing dominoes, drinking vodka, about 30 yards that way. [audience cheering and clapping] They’re just so happy the weird guy in the polyester pants and bushy mustache is looking after them for a while. Right in my face. Benson and Hedges. It stung right in the retinas. Stinging me like crazy. Smoke billowing down my body. But you know what? No allergies today. [audience cheering and clapping] Nada. I eat whatever I want. I can see a raccoon walking around midday. Just rip it’s face off, clumps of hair missing, doesn’t matter. I can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later. [audience laughing] You know why? ‘Cause I drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard. [audience cheering and clapping] That sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time, melting that plastic. It boiled up so much it would burn your face. It wouldn’t even come out in a steady stream. You’d be p-p-p-p-p… [audience laughing] Firing rusty spickets through that thing like BBs into the back of your throat until it wasn’t enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that. [audience laughing] Just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house. Just… [audience laughing] Go right to the source and I was fine. Why was I fine? ‘Cause all day long at school I’m chewing on pencils. [audience laughing] I’m sniffing magic markers like they’re going out of style. Thirty seconds a nostril. Have some fun. Get used to it. Eating paste ’cause it looked like mayonnaise. [audience laughing] Or Play-Doh. How good did Play-Doh smell? Smelled amazing. You try it, like, whoa, different story. [audience laughing] Next day, you try it again. Different color. You’re like, “Maybe this is fruit flavored. Try.” [audience laughing softly] We had allergies and things back in the day. We just didn’t label everything. I’m sure I had anxiety. I know I did. I was a pitcher. I was eight years old. I remember this. I had a really strong arm. I was on the mound. I was firing the ball, aiming it, and I was missing the plate. I started walking batters and it was getting to me. I loaded up the bases and I was breathing heavy. I felt it. I felt this heaviness. And it was bothering me. I started trying harder and I was walking more batters. I started walking runs in. I’m looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and I felt terrible. I remember this. ‘Cause I remember my dad, who was also a coach, he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. He literally walked up to the mound, he put both hands on my shoulder, looked me dead in the eyes and says, “Hey. Stop aiming the ball. You know what to do.” He said two words. “Just throw.” That’s all he said. “Just throw.” He turned around and he walked back to the dugout. And I remember it’s the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. Think about it. Anytime life has got you down, there are obstacles you gotta overcome. Just throw. That’s all you gotta do. Just throw. Yes. Believe in yourself. [audience cheering and clapping] Trust yourself. And just throw. And that’s what I did. I launched back into my windup and I just threw. And I shattered the kid’s cheekbone. I remember… [audience laughing and clapping] Ball bounced like 30 yards, two more runs scored. So my Dad was wrong there. You gotta aim the ball. [audience laughing] In baseball. That’s the… That’s like where… That’s the worst advice ever. To just, just throw it in baseball. Then you’re just running around, just throwing at everything. You can’t. You gotta… [audience laughing] Doesn’t work in baseball. But anywhere else in life, it’s great advice. Great advise. Just throw. Just do it. He was smart. My dad was a smart man. Never went to college. Didn’t have to. Didn’t know all subjects, but he knew subjects in depth. He had depth to the subject. That was it. He knew it. He knew it well. I don’t have that. I don’t know, my Dad was handing me the, uh, knowledge baton. He was literally like, “Here it is. From generation to generation. This is all the wisdom and intelligence of our family. And I’m giving it to you, my son.” And I was like… I’m good. [audience laughing] I don’t feel like reading that thing right now. I paid for it. ‘Cause he could answer any question I ever had. And I know nothing now. As an adult, I’m faking it. That’s why I hate having conversations. ‘Cause I don’t know enough. I know things, but I don’t ',\n",
       "  'have any in-depth knowledge. I can’t go deep. Still water does not go deep. That’s why, anybody talks to me, it’s literally like they say something and I have zero point of view. I can’t add anything to it. I’m just like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. [audience laughing] One subject, one subject I know a lot about. Buster Douglas. Remember him? Remember the heavy-weight champ who upset Mike Tyson back in 1990? At the Tokyo Dome. Forty-two to one odds. Mike Tyson was 37-and-0 at the time. 55,000 people there. I know all this. You know why I know it? Because ESPN had a 30 for 30 on it and I recorded it and watched it, like, 12 times. So I have all this information about Buster Douglas. Here’s the thing. Hardly ever comes up in conversation. [audience laughing] That’s how dumb I was. I put all my eggs in the Buster Douglas basket. [audience laughing] And my wife, this was the worst. We got invited to this local municipal government fundraising dinner. It was, like, every word I hated in there. Except dinner. I was fine with that. [audience laughing] Hope you said no. She was like, “I accepted.” Why would you do that? I don’t wanna talk to anybody. I can’t. I don’t know anything about government. They’re gonna make me look like an idiot. I don’t wanna do it. She’s like, “Relax.” She’s good at talking. She’s like, “I’ll go with you. I’ll be there the whole time. I promise you, we’ll mingle around, we’ll have some hors d’oeuvres, we’ll have a little dinner, and then we’ll leave. And I’ll stay with you the whole time.” You promise? She’s like, “Yes.” As soon as we get there she goes, “I’ll be right back. I have to go the bathroom.” And she takes off. [audience laughing] Some guy walks over to me. He says, “Hey.” I’m like, “Oh, gosh, here we go. Hey!” How about this whole Figueroa thing as councilman? Tell you one thing, he ain’t gonna last, huh? [audience laughing] Let’s break it down, shall we? First, don’t know who Figueroa is. Don’t know… You know what a councilman is? Do have any idea? He could’ve said carrot-maker. It wouldn’t have made a difference. I’ve no idea what a councilman is. [audience laughing] How do I answer? I wanna look like I know, so I go, “Really?” Like I’m concerned for Figueroa. He goes, “Yeah, really.” I go, “Why?” He goes, “I’ll give you one reason why. Treason.” I was like, “Treason? You gotta be kidding me.” In my head, I’m going, you don’t even know what treason means. [audience laughing] You don’t know the definition of treason. I don’t know… Did you ever break away from a conversation mentally to try to figure out a word that somebody just launched at you? You’re in your head, going, break it down. Treason. What does it mean? Treason. Well, tree is in the front, reason is in the back. Trees… are reasonable. Maybe he’s talking about the environment. Get in there and talk about the environment. So I go back to talk to him and he’s just staring at me. So I don’t know how long I was out for, you know. I don’t know if he asked me a question or not. He’s just staring at me. I’m starting to sweat, ’cause I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling uncomfortable. And he doesn’t say… So I go to my fallback, which is this. It’s great. I just go, “Yeah, it’s all crazy anyway. What are you gonna do, right? He’s supposed to say, “Yeah, it’s nuts. Anyway, you have a good night.” You too. But he doesn’t. He goes, “What’s crazy?” I go, “I don’t know. No one’s ever answered my question with a question before.” [audience laughing] Just the whole thing. He’s like, “What whole thing?” How it all went down. He’s like, “What went down?” Motherf… Just leave me alone! [audience laughing] He was trying to expose my stupidity. He wouldn’t stop. He was not letting me go. He was chasing me, like I was an opossum running behind a dumpster and he had a flashlight in my face. What did you say? No, you’re dumb. What did you say? You’re very dumb. You don’t know who Figueroa is. Who is Figueroa? No, you don’t. Who is Figueroa? Who is Figueroa? Who is he? You don’t… Name the three branches of government. [audience laughing] I’ll spot you Legislative. [audience cheering and clapping] I should just be honest with people. I should just walk up, “Hi, my name’s Kevin. I got about a fourth grade vocabulary.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna get lost pretty quickly into the conversation, but I’ll stay here and I’ll nod my head and I’ll smile, make you feel better about yourself, but don’t be fooled, I am dead behind the eyes. [audience laughing and clapping] I don’t do that. I try to match. I try to match. I throw in big words I don’t even know. What do you think the problem with society is? I go, “I gotta be honest. I harken…” Har… Harken. [audience laughing] I’ve never said “harken” before in my life. Harken? What am I? Winston Churchill? Where… It behooves me to think that… my monocle and my, mm, pocket watch, ha-ha, burlap brown pants, working on the cobble stone in London, fatty, fatty, fatty pants. Fatty pants. Walking in London rain. Who am I? Mm, pipe. Who am I? Harken. Or I answer too quickly. What do you think the problem with the culture is? I’m like, “I know what it is.” I know what it is? [audience laughing] I go, “I think it’s a lack of conscious.” Conte-ness. Consci-ness. He’s like, “What?” You ever not even be sure of the tense of a word? C… It’s a lack of con… conscien',\n",
       "  'ce-ness. [audience laughing] I’m sorry, what did you say? C-Con… It’s a lack of consciention… [audience laughing] It’s a lack of con… uncon… I think unconscien… unconscientuously. I think uncon… con… Conscience… Conchi… It’s a lack of conch… Of we’re not uncontentience. [audience laughing] You’re gonna have a society… S-so… So-socotal… Socielitally… You’re gonna get a tyranny. A tyr… A tyran… An tyrannical-saurus rex is gonna come back. [audience laughing] And the dinosaurs are here. That’s what I’m saying. I’m sorry, I’m not following you. I went… [scoffs] Irregardless of that, I gotta tell you… I said it. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, he stopped me, “That’s not even a word.” I beg to differ. He’s like, “I’m sorry, you’re not making any sense.” [audience laughing softly] You know what else didn’t make sense? When Buster Douglas upset Mike Tyson back in 1990. [audience cheering and clapping] At the Tokyo Dome. 55,000 people. Forty-two to one odds. You have a good night, sir. Have a good night, sir. [audience clapping] That’s when my wife walked out of the bathroom. What did I miss? Anything good? Ha-ha. Okay. All right. My wife’s awesome. I love her so much. She… We’re an amazing fit because she loves to talk. She’s like the balance to me. She’s so good at it. She can talk to people. She knows what questions to ask. She just loves it. I remember, that night we got in the car to drive home. She just started talking again. I was like, “Hey. You know, we don’t need it now. We…” [audience laughing] We don’t need to talk ever again. [audience laughing] We don’t. That’s a good thing. We’ve been together, like, 20 years. I’ve already said every word I’m ever gonna say to her in every combination. That’s it. And she said every word to me. She knows everything about me. I know everything about her. We don’t need to talk anymore. We can finish out the rest of our life with gestures. That’s it. [audience laughing] Not her. She loves to talk. She loves it. She’s just one of those people. She just loves it. Loves the sound of her internal voice. She’s like, “Uh…” Loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something. The whole nine yards. Whatever’s involved with talking, she… [makes noises] Ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice? They’re ma-ma-ma-ma. Brr… Brr… Brr… La-la. Brr… She just goes. I don’t think she’s ever had an unexpressed thought in her life. [audience laughing] No. Everything she sees, it goes right in, and she has to say it. She just, “Oh, my gosh, this door’s so squeaky. That picture’s crooked, I can’t believe that. We’re gonna make eggplant for Thursday. We’ll have some friends over. Would that be good? Look at my reflection in the mirror. I see two of me. Do you see two of me? It’s really weird. I can’t believe the kids are standing on hardwood floor now, look at that. The lights are good. The holidays are coming. This is fun.” Hey, sit one out. Sit one out. [audience laughing] I have thoughts in my head all day long. Weird ones. How many tater tots can I fit in my mouth without dropping any? [audience laughing] It’s in there, but I keep it in the barn. I keep it in there. Not my wife. She doesn’t have any barn doors. It’s just free-range thoughts. I see it. I say it. I see it in the senses and I say it. Look at those exit signs. The light. The floor. Everything is… I see it. I say it. I see it. I say it. It’s like a verbal wood chipper. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] I see it. I say it. I gotta say it when I see it. I see it. I say it. I gotta say it. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] Hey. There’s an ebb and flow to conversations. There is. Fifty percent is listening. It’s like double Dutch. You gotta wait for your turn. [audience laughing] Not her. She’s in there the whole time. Like… I got this. This is my talk. This is my talk. Back it off. Can someone else talk? Get outta here, [unclear], this is me. Big Mac, Fillet-o-Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries, I see Coke, milkshake, sundaes, and apple pie. [audience cheering and clapping] You wanna talk? Talk. Go in your closet, take your clothes off, and talk all night long. But why do I have to be there? [audience laughing] It’s this emotional backboard. She doesn’t care what I think or say. She wants me there. Why? Talk. Go. I always gotta be there, though. I’m literally brushing my teeth. Getting ready for bed. And I hear it. [audience laughing] Telling me things. That I experienced with her. I was with her all day. [audience laughing] Can’t believe Alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son. I didn’t like that at all. I couldn’t believe it. Could you believe it? In my head, I’m going, “Yes, I can. You know why? ‘Cause I was there.” [audience laughing] This was your point of view. [audience laughing] This was mine. I was there. I experienced everything with you! Na-na-na-na-na… Talking herself to sleep. Literally talking herself through sleep. You know how much you wanna go to sleep and you’re tired? And she’s still fighting it. [mumbling] [exhale, mumbling] [mumbling] Finally. It goes quiet. Sweet quiet. You go to bed. Next morning I wake up. [audience laughing softly] I’m brushing my teeth. And it starts up again in the other room. [audience laughing] I’m like, “What new knowledge did you pick up…” [audience laughing',\n",
       "  '] “…overnight?” What did you get? What could you have picked up? Nothing new happened. [audience laughing softly] But she wants me there. She wants me in that conversation. Again, doesn’t care about what I have to say. Does… doesn’t matter. She wants me there. And she tries to get me snagged into these conversations. She’ll like lob out half sentences to me. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me. [loud sigh] I sure hope Ellen’s gonna be okay. [audience laughing] I usually let the first one just pass by. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if enough time passes, I can just kinda… [mumbles] [audience laughing] But there’s always a follow-up. Sure hope they can work through this. Okay, we gotta engage. [audience laughing] I’m thinking, “What’s our plan?” Our plan is, we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible. We have so much stuff to do. But we can’t try to shorten the conversation. We know that, ’cause she’ll sense that. She’s good at that. And then she’ll tack on 45 minutes just out of spite, so… [audience laughing softly] What if I steer into it? What if I go in the other way? It’s dangerous, but it’s… Risky move, but it could pay off. Let’s just go into it and I did it. Hey, honey. Yeah. Let’s do it. Let’s do what? Let’s just talk about Helen all morning long. [audience laughing] Let’s just do it. We’ll grab a couple of beanbag chairs. Put on a pot of coffee. We’ll sit down. You tell me everything about Helen from conception to this morning. [audience laughing] Let’s do it. Let’s just get knee-deep in Helen. What do you say? Okay, first of all, it’s Ellen. It’s not Helen. There’s no H, okay? [audience laughing] She’s my friend from Pilates who you don’t know. She’s going through some stuff right now. But let’s do it. Let’s just do it anyway. I don’t care. I wanna learn about her. And I wanna be here to learn about her, with you. What do you say? [loud exhale] [audience laughing] No. I promised her I wouldn’t say anything to anybody. [audience laughing] Okay. I really wanted to be here for you. I love you. I just wanted to let you know that. I’ll see you later, okay. [audience cheering and clapping] There’s always a follow-up. All right, I’ll tell you. But you gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody else. Promise you? I can’t do that. What if I’m playing softball with the guys? And we’re warming up and I’m throwing with my buddy and he’s like, “Hey, anything going on with your wife’s friends at Pilates that I should know about?” [audience laughing] I can’t believe you brought that up. Yes. Guys, bring it in. Everybody, bring it in, both teams. Come out of the dugout. Everybody, take a knee. I wanna tell you about my wife’s friend Ellen or Helen, who I don’t know, from Pilates. [audience laughing] She’s going through some stuff right now. No, hands down, I’ll answer questions afterwards. [audience laughing] You gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody. How about I promise you I’m not listening to a word you’re saying as you’re saying it? How about none of your words are actually reaching my ears? Nothing. Nothing. They’re exploding in the atmosphere before they reach me like a fourth of July party, like… [soft popping sounds] I can’t believe… [popping sounds] I can’t believe she named… [popping sounds] And I told her her coworkers… [popping sounds] I’m getting none of this. [popping sounds] I’m getting none of it. [popping sounds] I didn’t even know you were taking Pilates. [popping sounds] [audience laughing] Just gotta beat her at her own game. That’s all you gotta do. Fourteen. What? Fourteen. What? That’s how many tater tots I think I can fit my mouth without dropping any. You guys are the greatest!

       " ['[Hip-hop music playing] ♪♪ [Cheers and applause] Miami, make some noise… [Cheers and applause] For Mr. Marlon Wayans! ♪♪ ♪♪ How the fuck we doing, Miami? [Cheers and applause] Thank you. I love you, too! Thank you. I do. I really do love you guys. I mean, I swear. I love people. I’m a lover of life. You know what I mean? Life in general. And it’s like, as you get older, I learned, I’m like 90% love, but there’s, like, 10% of shit I hate. A lot of things I hate… Well, people hate… Come from fear, right? The thing I hate most comes from the thing I fear most. And it comes from, like, childhood trauma. And this is gonna sound crazy to you, but… [Sighs] Okay, fuck it. I am so scared of n*ggas with outie belly buttons. It’s just something evil about a n*gga with a outie belly button. You know what I’m talking about? Like, Andre McLaurin… he had an outie belly button. He was the bully in my hood. He terrorized me my whole childhood. He was an evil little n*gglet. 4 years old, he was buff. Look like Kevin Hart buff. Like… Looked like he just got out of baby prison and shit. And he was a kid. 4 years old, he had lats. The only way you get lats is from doing prison time and doing pull-ups. He was a badass little kid. He was so evil, his first baby tooth, it came in chipped. [Laughter] And he was an evil fucker. He used to always steal the one cherry out of my fruit cocktail at lunchtime. And if you went to a public school, you know how much that fucking one cherry meant to you? It took you 15 cups to get to the fucking cherry. Otherwise, it was all grapes and fucking nectarines. Yo, I don’t want that shit. I want a cherry! And Andre, he had an outie belly button, right, and he had this six-pack. And the outie belly button looked like someone threw a Vienna sausage at that n*gga’s stomach and it caught. [Grunts] He was bowlegged. All them little outie belly button dudes, they… They all bowlegged ’cause they mama make ’em walk when they only 5 months old before their legs harden. [Laughs] And then she give him… Because she doesn’t believe in walkers or strollers. She goes, “Those are for pussies!” She make him walk when he 5 months old and she give him man responsibility, ’cause you know his daddy ain’t there. Oh, outie belly button n*ggas ain’t got no daddy, shit. And they make them go… “Take your little brother Lamar to school!” And she put Lamar on his neck, and be, “I’ll take him,” and that weighed down his legs. So he walk around with heavy-ass Lamar on his shoulders, and now he gotta go, “Take Dede to daycare!” And now he gotta drag his little brother Dede to daycare. “Come on!” And she always screams shit to him out the window. Quit smoking my Newports! “I know it’s you, you piece of shit!” That was his little nickname. “Piece of shit!” He be out till, like, 5:30 in the morning with his saggy diaper full of shit, just… Oh, they ain’t potty trained. Outie belly button n*ggas is dumb as shit. They can’t read or write or don’t know their ABC’s or 123s, but they’re super athletic. They can backflip into a public pool with their jeans and sneakers on. So he walking around the neighborhood just looking for trouble with a little saggy-ass diaper hanging out his fucking G-Star jeans, and he just looking for trouble. Walking around the neighborhood, smoking his mama’s cigarettes, just…[Inhaling] But he’s still a kid, so he suck his thumb, too. [Laughs] Never fight a b*tch with a outie belly button. You will lose that fight. Oh, let me tell you something, outie belly button women, they can do two things. They can fight, and they can fuckin’ Double Dutch. Oh, shit. They always got Vaseline in their back pocket. And they put it on their face and say evil shit like, “Oh, b*tch, this what I wanted you to do! Oh, b*tch, I prayed for God you was gonna fuck with me today, ho! Ooh, I’ma fuck you up.” And they always got… They always got little… Little “B*tch, I can fight” hairdos. They got cornrows, right? But the cornrows be real little, ’cause they ain’t got a lot of hair, so it look like stitches. Look like Wolverine went… [Deep voice] “Get over here, b*tch!” [Normal voice] And they hair’s so small [chuckles] the shit be unraveling. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So they put them little colorful hair braids on the back, but half the time, they can’t afford that, so they put them Venus and Serena braids… Beads… on the end, and clump them with some aluminum foil? And God forbid if she got that “b*tch, I could fight” ponytail. You know them little ponytail? It look more like a Rottweiler tail or a Doberman Pinscher tail? It’s a little struggle tail. Oh, and her girlfriend help her get that little bit of hair in a ponytail, be like, “Shit, sit still, Faye, sit still! We almost got it!” And the hair never make it. The ponytail never make it. All this be broke off. There will be, like, nine scraggly hairs here and, like, seven over here. And she gotta slick it down with some Vaseline and try to make some baby hair. But one time she sweat, boom, that shit come right back up. And all this be bald as shit. This be bald. Look like somebody fading her shit at all times. But it’s ’cause all',\n",
       "  ' the stress from trying to have a ponytail when, b*tch, you ain’t got no hair, so… Her eyes be s… Real tight, you know? She got the tight eyes? It’s because she actually gotta put her skin in the ponytail to make the ponytail reach. And when it reaches, it’s finally, it’s a little, little ponytail. [Child’s voice] Oh, it’s so little! And it look like… [Normal voice] B*tch look like a water balloon. I’ma give you some stats on outie belly button people, and then we can move on, ’cause I’m really offending this brother with the outie belly button in the front row. Him and his comrade. Uh, these are real statistics. You can look it up after the show. Uh, Google it. Whatever search engine you use, Safari perhaps. Firefox. Uh… [Exhales sharply] They’re terrible people, outie belly buttons, they menaces to society. You know that 87.3% of our entire prison system is filled with n*ggas with outie belly buttons. 84.6% of all the fathers that don’t take care of their children. It’s a shame. Outie belly b… [Laughs] Every rapper that’s ever been to prison? The n*gga got a outie belly button. I ain’t lyin’. They always got they shirt off in pictures. Google it. Meek Mill… outie belly button. Lil Wayne… outie belly button. Bobby Shmurda and his whole crew of… ♪ We be on some block b*tches ♪\\n♪ To the tone, to the tone to the top ♪ All got outie belly buttons and saggy Pampers hanging out their G-Star jeans. Ready? Lil Baby and DaBaby outie belly button. Ready for this? Kodak Black. Yeah, this n*gga got a outie belly with a outie belly button. Oh, he’s an anomaly. It’s not just a Black thing, okay? White folks, you sitting here, having a good old laugh at us minorities. [Imitating White voice] [Laughs] [Normal voice] This is the biggest stat of all. Ready, White folks? 99.99%… of all them White folks that bum-rushed the Capitol… [Laughter] [Cheers and applause] The insurgents all had outie belly buttons. [Laughs] Donald Trump got a outie belly b… [Laughs] That’s why he wears those long ties. He’s trying to hide it. [Chuckles] I know, this is real shit. You know what’s funny? I almost didn’t have children, because I was afraid one of them was gonna have an outie belly button. I got kids, got two. [Applause] Yes. Some brave woman let me cum in her twice. And that’s 90 p… I love them, man. My daughter, she just graduated, uh, high school. [Cheers and applause] And she went to her prom. Yeah. Which for the father of a daughter is a miserable fucking evening. No, ’cause, you know, prom night, that’s the night that your baby girl’s gonna lose her virginity. Ladies, y’all ain’t shit. Y’all ain’t shit. Ain’t nobody correct me. None of y’all are worth a damn cent. Look at y’all. You gonna sit here and let me and your n*gga next to you believe that you lost it prom night? Yeah, right. You know you lost that shit in the tenth grade in some fucking stairwell to a random Puerto Rican named Orlando. [Chuckles] Prom night’s just the first night your nasty ass gonna do it in the bed, and your daddy gotta pay for it. See, I don’t… I don’t like the setup ’cause I feel like a sucker as a father. “Cause prom night is not about impressing the daughter or the mother. No. See, the mother and the daughter, they in cahoots with this little motherfucker across town, who’s trying to come fuck your daughter. That’s what they’re trying to do, fuck your daughter. What’s he doing? Trying to fuck your daughter. And he come, and he come, he think he Prince Charming. He pull up in a limousine. Oh, he’s wearing a tuxedo, and he has these shiny tuxedo shoes on. And he rings the doorbell all respectfully. [Imitates doorbell] Boom-boom. And you open the door, and he says some really polite thing like, “How are you, Mr. Wayans? It’s a pleasure to meet your acquaintance. I’m here to pick up Amai.” And then he produces a corsage. “Ooh, a corsage! Ooh, for my daughter?” Oh! You gentleman, you! Here. Fuck her. “You fuck my daughter, you gentleman, you!” Get the fuck outta here with that bull… Slap you in your little face. Don’t come to my door with that shit. Don’t do that. You come to my house, you trying to bang my daughter, be a man! You wanna pick up my daughter? Be a man. Don’t come in some limousine your daddy rented for you. No, I’m not impressed. You come in some shit you could afford. You show up to my house on them little… Little scooty bikes you rent in the street, like… Yeah, better yet, come on a skateboard. Just come to the house like, “Ka-ta, ka-ta, ka-ta.” Impress me! Do a trick up the stairs or some shit. Oh! And don’t wear no tuxedo. I’m not impressed by that shit. Nah, don’t wear no tuxedo. Some rent-a-tux. Come on, man. You wear it today, but it was on a dead body yesterday. You smell like embalming fluid. You come to my house, you show up… I’m a ’90s n*gga. So you come to my house, impress me. You wear a pair of FUBU jeans. Yeah, some Karl Kani, something with some big writing on the pocket. And make sure you have an Aniche shirt and a Mecca sweater over that. Tie a Phat Farm cardigan around your neck. Yeah, and then have a Eight-Ball jacket just sitting off your shoulders like Dom Perignon. And then you have a Ya',\n",
       "  'nkee fitted that’s not that fitted just sitting off the side of your dome. And don’t bend the brim. Leave that shit new! Don’t bend the brim. And you better not take the sticker off. I wanna see that little black sticker with your head size. I wanna be like, “Oh! Seven and five eighths? Oh, he got a big-ass head. He’s smart!” And when you come to my house, do me a favor. Don’t ring my doorbell. [Imitating doorbell] Boom-boom. Nah. Nah. Let’s be real. You don’t come to me with disguising your evil R&B Trey Songz intentions, nah. You tryin’ to fuck my daughter. “Boom-boom” says, “Love you!” Get the fuck outta here. Come with some… Knock on my door. Knock! Let me hear you knock. Don’t ring my doorbell. Knock. Yeah, that’s a real n*gga right there. And let me hear your intentions in the knock. I wanna hear your knock say, “I’m here to fuck your daughter!” You feel me? That… that gets my attention. “Boom-boom” don’t get my attention. N*gga, I be on the toilet taking a shit, I hear “Boom-boom, boom-boom,” I ignore it. I just keep checking my Instagram. “Boom-boom, boom-boom,” dropping my load. [Grunts] “Boom-boom.” [Grunts] “Boom-boom.” But if I hear, “I’m here to fuck your daughter!” I be like, “Oh, shit, he here!” I don’t even wipe my ass. I just pull up and be like, “Oh, he here! He here, n*gga!” I’ll wipe later. And when I open the door, do me a favor. Don’t say no smart shit to me like, “How are you doing, Mr. Wayans? Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I’m here to pi…” I’ll choke you, pussy! Don’t… Don’t do that. Just shut the fuck up. You come to bang my daughter, let’s be real. Don’t say nothing. Have some fucking empathy. What you trying to do, huh? You trying to love her? No, no. You trying to fuck my daughter. Let me tell you something, my guy, that’s my b*tch. Yeah, my pussy made that pussy, so respect the guy when you come through! Don’t say no smart shit to me, [Mocking voice] “How you doing Mr. Way…” [Normal voice] Shut up! Just look at me and have some compassion, have some empathy. You took your S.A.T.? That’s a S.A.T. word. You took your S.A.T.’s, you got a 870 or over, you know what the fuck empathy is. “Cause you give me that look like you know what the fuck I’m going through as a father. I open the door, be like… [makes creaking sound] “Just give me that look like you understand, like…” [Exhales] [Sighs] Then say some cool shit like… [Inhales deeply] [Deep voice] “You know what it is.” [Normal voice] “You know what it is.” That’s real n*gga talk right there. You won my heart with “You know what it is,” ’cause “You know what it is” says so much without saying shit. So, let’s say like… And brothers understand this. Like, let’s say I’m leaving the amphitheater tonight and I see some young brothers outside and they wanna rob me. And they see it’s me, and they be impressed like, “Oh, shit!” N*gga, that’s Marlon Wayans! Oh, I love you! Wayans Brothers? Wayans Brothers? Wayans Brothers? Come on, my guy. ♪ We brothers ♪\\n♪ We happy and we singing and we colored ♪\\n♪ Da-da-da-da ♪\\n♪ Gimme a high five! ♪ That was my shit. Yo, ‘Little Man’? Yo, I cried at ‘Little Man’, ’cause I got a cousin that small, man, so I know that shit be real. “And then ‘White Chicks’? Yo, that shit was a lit…” [Cheers and applause] “Yo, that… Yeah, it was a little gay, but, n*gga, that shit was funny though. But, yo, yo, I love y’all, man! Yo, my family love your family, but, yo…” [Sniffs] “Me and my n*ggas is hungry.” And you got that little chain on, you know what I’m saying? And I like them sneakers you got on. So as much as I love you… [sniffs] “You know what it is.” [Cheers and applause] [Normal voice] Somebody give me that shit, and here, “Take the chain. Take my sneakers.” That’s a real n*gga right there. Don’t even pull the gun out, just take it. The heist is done. Same thing with my daughter. “N*gga, here, take her, take her, take her. She deserve a real n*gga like you.” And then when you grab her, grab her hand and be like, “Yo, listen, you did a good job, man. Just do yourself a favor. Don’t wait up.” And pull up on your skateboard, ka-ta, ka-ta, ka-ta. And don’t let her on. Let her chase after you like a real n*gga. And then turn around and show me your outie belly button like, “You know what it is! You know this shit is real!” I actually had no anxiety at all on my daughter’s prom night. Not a drop. Know why? ‘Cause my daughter’s gay, so, yeah. [Chuckles] That took all… All the anxiety away. You know what’s funny? Knowing that my daughter wasn’t gonna be banging some dude or getting pregnant or having no disease, I… That doorbell rang, I was so relieved. I went to the doorbell… Boom-boom! I looked through the peephole, I seen it was a girl, I said, “Yes!” [Laughs] “Ooh, this b*tch is bad, too. Hey, how you doing? Ah, don’t call me Mr. Wayans, call me Mama!” [Smooches] “Amai, your date is here!” Oh, baby girl, don’t you look beautiful? Look at you. Don’t she look pretty? But why your dress so long, girl? Hike your dress up. Yeah, show some pussy. She ho… Yeah. Girl, you safe. This like fishing. Throw that chum in the water. Go on, show some pussy! “Now, you girls have fun. Don’t do noth',\n",
       "  \"ing I wouldn’t do.” [Evil laugh] “Now, check it out, I got y’all a little hotel room, and guess what? It’s a suite! Curfew? B*tch, stay out till Thursday, yeesh.” “Now, check it out, I got y’all some party favors.” I got you, uh [sniffs] I got you a little bit of weed. Just tell the driver you want some collard greens, he got that shit rolled up for you. I got you some liquor. I got that good liquor. I got that Ciroc. Yeah, that shit that make Diddy and his kids dance like this. Every time they hear “Ciroc,” they just be dancing like this. Here, take this Molly. Take the Molly. Don’t do the whole pill. I got this shit from Miami, “I don’t know what the fuck is in this shit.” [Cheers and applause] “Just give her half, and you take the other half. You do the whole thing, trust me, it’s gonna be really hard for you to eat vagina like this.” [Chuckles] That’s just how it was, man. I ain’t trippin’. My daughter told me she was gay when she was, uh, she was how old? She was 15 years old. And, uh, you know, I realized I’m not God. I can’t judge. I’m a father. And my job as a father is to love my daughter unconditionally, no matter what. So, I told my daughter, you know, I said, “Listen, baby girl,” I said, “You know, I accept you, but for you,” I said, “Don’t be concreted in your thoughts”, because you’re still a baby. I mean, life is not a sprint. This is a marathon. “And what you love today, you may hate tomorrow.” And I cited an example, I said, “Remember when you was little, you hated peas?” Yeah, you did. You fucking hated peas. And what did we do? We went to the bookstore, and we got that book. ‘Green Eggs and Ham’ by Dr. Seuss. Now who loves peas? You do! Right, so let’s go to the bookstore, and let’s see if we can find another book. ‘Green Eggs and Dick’ by Dr. Seuss. Yeah, and Daddy will read it to you “like I did when you was little.” [Clears throat] “‘You can suck it in the park.” You can fuck it in the dark. You can suck it in the rain. Watch out for big, buff, Black dick. It will surely give you pain. Oh, dick, it comes in all shapes. Some are narrow, some are wide! Some are round at the top and others have sleeves. They call those uncircumcised. And if you know these dicks I’m speaking, the uncircumcised ones usually belong “to Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.'” [Laughter] [Chuckles] No, but my daughter was like, “No, Dad, you’re not getting it.” She said, “I’m gay, so you love me or you leave me alone.” And she gave me two options, but I only heard one, which is to love her, right? Yeah. I mean, it actually made me look at myself. Like, the fact that she’s living her truth? I picked up the mirror and I said, “Shit, am I living my truth? I’m lying here next to her mother every night, and this shit don’t feel right.” “I’m wearing these skinny-ass leather pants that’s giving me male camel toe. What the fuck is going on?” And I realized something. I wasn’t living my truth. And I thanked my daughter. I said, “Thank you, you freed me.” I said, “Baby girl, Daddy likes pussy, too.” “I do! Oh, I love pussy! Not your mama’s. I’m tired of that shit.” I’ve been fucking that for 25 years. It’s like an old piece of chewing gum. I just wanna put it up underneath a desk and watch it get on somebody else’s jeans and be laughing. I’ve learned I like all kinds of pussy. I like White pussy. Yes, I said it, sisters. And I’ll say it to your face. I like White pussy. So white, you can hear the “H” when I pronounce it. Hh-white! And look at this brother, he smiling. He said, “Man, me too!” And I like them a little racist. I like a little Karen. I’ll go down… I’ll go down to Sarasota and grab me a fucking Karen, and I’ll fuck her ass and change her whole perspective. I’ll put that dick so deep, she’ll be like, [Screaming] “Black Lives Matter!” [Cheers and applause, laughter] And I like Latina chocha. Sí! Me gusta Latina chocha mucho! Yeah, I like the gorda labias. Ah, yes. And [with accent] yes, yes. [Normal voice] And then I fuck, and she fucking call me names, she like, “Ay, negrito sucio!” And I say, “Sí.” Negrito su… cio!” And I like Black. I like Black, Black, Black, Bla-a-a-a-a-a-ck pussy. I’m talking fucking Black Lives Matter black. Civil Rights Movement black. Wyclef Jean’s kneecap black. Bobby Brown crack finger black. [Laughs] Wesley Snipes’ everything black. And that pussy been through so much. All Black women been through so much trouble and oppression. She ain’t impressed by nothing you do. You can’t hurt that pussy. You pull their panties down and pussy got attitude, look at you like, “Tsk.” “That’s all you got?” [Sighs deeply] Ah, it feels so good to live my truth. Thank you, baby girl, for accepting me. [Sighs] Come on. Let’s go live our truth. Let’s go tell your mother, huh? You first, b*tch. I’ll be over here. I’m proud. I’m so proud of her that Pride month passed, and I put a post up on my Instagram. And I wrote her a beautiful caption. I said, “Happy Pride Month to my pride and joy. I’m so proud of you for living your truth, for having the courage to just be you.” I said, “Daddy loves you to the moon and back”, around the stars, through every galaxy. And one day, when God tak\",\n",
       "  'es me, may he bring me back again to find you exactly the way you are and love you for the rest of eternity. “Love always, Daddy.” [Applause] But you know, on Instagram, there’s always that one comment. That one negative n*gga with a little dick. Lonely, insecure, mad he living in his mama’s basement that’s full of fucking mold. Well, this piece of shit… Chaz0135. He writes, “I can’t believe you would teach your daughter this.” I said, “Hey, motherfucker. I didn’t teach this little girl how to be gay!” How do you teach somebody to be gay? Tell me. What do you think I did? You think I sat her down and told her her alphabets like this? “Listen, fuck ABC. All you need to know is LGBTQ. That’s all!” I didn’t teach her to be gay. Sometimes that’s just the way they are. I need y’all to listen to your kids. I should have known she was gay. You know how? I remember when my daughter was born, right? My daughter was three… My daughter was three and a half weeks late when we gave birth to her. Three and a half weeks. We had to induce labor. We used Pitocin to get her out. Her mother was in labor for 42 hours, trying to push this little girl out. So obviously, this little b*tch loved pussy! But see, I wasn’t listening. So I look at guys like Chaz0135, and I go, “Listen, sometimes that’s just the way the child comes. And how dare you try to shame a young lady that’s just trying to find her way in the world.” That shit pissed me off. I’m a troll, I went to that motherfucker’s profile, I started looking… Thinking of jokes. Oh, I called my brothers. Yes, I called for backup. I said, “Shawn, Keenen, Damon. Instagram. Chaz0135. Koo-koo!” [Applause] Oh, we a family full of n*ggas. They hit me back with the “Soo!” Yeah, and I was starting to… Like, we about to light him up with jokes, but then I saw that Chaz0135 had a brand-new baby girl. And so I seen where his insecurity was coming from. So I instantly called my boys off, called the boys off, was like… [makes bird sound] Oh, that’s bird talk for “Back up, back up, back up.” And they hit me back with the…[makes bird sound] That’s, “Alright, n*gga, you good, you good, you good.” [Chuckles] Because I know some… I’m gonna tell you something. I’m a… I’m a man of God. “No weapon formed against me shall prosper.” Yes. I saw the same Tyler Perry movie as you, sister, same one. Because you realize something, that there’s a karma to life. You ain’t gotta do nothing to bad people. Let me tell you something, Chaz0135. One day when your baby girl grows up, and she turns 19, and she comes out the closet. I’m gonna have my daughter fuck her! ‘Cause I’m a motherfucking troll like that. [Laughter] Guess what? I got gay friends. You should see the looks that I get from people when I hang out with my gay friends. Even my straight guy friends be looking at me when I hang out with my gay guy friends. They be looking at me like, “Oh, hey, watch out, bro. Watch out.” “Watch out for what? This shit ain’t contagious. This shit ain’t COVID. Like, you can’t catch gay, n*gga, like…” You acting like I hang out with my gay friends and I catch gay and I show up the next day and I’m just coughing up dick. “Hey, Marlon, how you doing?” “I don’t feel so good!” “What happened to you?” “Oh, I hung out with Aubrey, and he sneezed on me, and I just been coughing up dick all day!” [Sneezes] “Oh, I keep this up, I think I’m gonna have to call in dick to work. This getting crazy.” No, can’t catch gay. And I’m glad I got my gay friends. ‘Cause that’s who I consulted with when it was time for me to figure out my daughter. I sat my gay buddy down, I said, “Hey, bro,” I said, “Let me ask you ask you a question.” I said, “When did you know you were gay?” He looked at me, he said, [Effeminate voice] “Well…” [Normal voice] He… he did. He got… he got noodley on me. He said, [Effeminate voice] “Well…” [Normal voice] And he made this little noise. He went [clicks tongue] I said, “What the fuck? What was that noise? You just pull off an imaginary penis to answer my question?” [Laughs] You know, me and my friend, we continued to talk. He asked, “What are you gonna do?” And I said, “I’m gonna accept her.” And he said, “That’s the only thing you can do. I wasn’t so lucky. I haven’t spoken to my father since the day I came out.” And that shit fucked me up, man. That shit had me thinking. I was like, “Damn. What if it was my son that was gay?” Like, what would that prom night be like? Let’s go on a little journey. [Chuckles] Doorbell rings. “Boom-boom.” I get all excited. Yeah, let’s see what he working with! [Laughs] [Screams] Unh-unh. What in the fuck? Aw. This n*gga. “Shawn, come downstairs, your dick is here.” I mean, your date is here! Yeah, there’s weed in the glove box. Roll me a blunt, please. Shit, I need one. Uh, also, guys, I-I got you some, uh, liquor. I got liquor. I got Ciroc in there. Yeah, yeah, you can drink the Ciroc. But also I got you some Hennessy. You may wanna pour the brown liquor on your booty hole and just numb it up a little “before you do what you’re gonna do.” And I be like, “Here, here, hey, guys, here. Take the Molly. Take the Molly. Wait, how… how tall are you? 6’4”? ',\n",
       "  'Oh, Goddamn, here take five. May be a little easier for you to take that dick “if you’re a little bit high.” Like…[groans] But then I would take a beat, and I would think to myself that on the other side of my fear is my son. My child that God gave me, the boy that I raised. And no child deserves to go unloved or unsupported because of their sexuality. [Applause] This is a real issue for fathers, especially in the Black community. So yes, I will call my gay son back. I’ll be like, “Come here, n*gga. Come here. Come here. Just him please. Thanks, Sasquatch.” I’ll be like, “Look, I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.” It’s just that, you know, this whole gay thing just crept up on me from behind. Not behind like, ‘Oh!’ You know what I mean? You know, it’s just that, you know, I’m just having a hard time trying to swallow it. Not swallow it like [gagging] Okay, it’s just that, when you was little, I-I-I was like, ‘Hey, I got a son, and we gonna play ball together! Yay!’ And I didn’t know you wanted to play with dudes, so that’s kinda fucking me up. But let me ask you something. Are you happy? No, are you really happy? And this is your life? Then fuck it, I’m happy for you. And I accept you. You’re my son. Come here, boy, I love you. I’m proud of you. Come here. Give me a hug, come here. Put your arms around me. Stop being gay. Put your arms around me. I love you, boy. [Smooches] Alright. Go ahead, n*gga, go enjoy your prom night. “Yeah, you look pretty in your dress, okay?” Just do me a favor. For your dad. From n*gga… to n*ggette. Just don’t be no b*tch-ass n*gga. You fuck that n*gga in his ass. Yeah! You give him the Wayans stroke! Yeah, boy! Yeah! Yeah, boy! Yeah, boy! Yeah! [Speaks indistinctly] I got a son. He ain’t gay, but he’s an asshole. I don’t know what happens to kids when they become teenagers. They just turn into dickheads. My son’s a dickhead. Like, you know, when he was little, when he was 4 years old, that boy worshipped the ground I walked on. I couldn’t go anywhere without him following me around or crying. I would leave the house for one minute, this boy would lose his mind. [Crying] “I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my daddy! No, get off me, Mom! I don’t want you, I want Dad!” [Normal voice] And I’d come back in the house, I’d be like, “Hey, son! I’m home!” He’d go, “Dad!” and he would run to me, and he’d grab my leg and go, “Dad, you my best friend. Don’t ever leave again. Don’t ever leave again.” And I’d say, “Aw, there, there, little n*gga. [Chuckles] I just went to the store, man. Get the fuck up off me.” That’s when my son was 4 years old. My son is 18 years old now. Boy, does times change. I was gone for three and a half months. Three and a half months. I would call my son. Shit go right to voicemail. So I text his little ass. He didn’t text me back. No bubbles, no nothing. He wasn’t even attempting to hit me back. So I FaceTime his ass. Shit said “Unavailable.” Just a picture of me looking stupid like… So I hit him on Facebook. You know he unfriended me? So I dipped into his Instagram. This motherfucker unfollowed me. But he still follows Chaz0135. So now at this point, I’m like, “What’s this dude’s problem?” And I started getting mad, but then I started thinking, “Well, maybe he just misses me, and he don’t know how to express that.” But you know what? When I come home after three and a half months, he’s gonna come running to me like he did when he was little. He’s gonna grab my leg and say, “Dad, don’t ever leave again. Don’t ever leave again.” And, boy, was I wrong. I came in the house after three and a half months. I was so cocky. I walked in, I dropped my bags, I said, “Son! Daddy’s home!” This jackass looked at me, he said, [Sniffs] “What up, n*gga?” And then he walked away. I said, “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, n*gga”, if you don’t get the fuck over here and give me the proper greeting, a hug and a kiss, I swear to God, I will shove you back in my dick, “and I will shoot you into a sock!” Yeah, you better consider yourself lucky you here. It’s ’cause of me. It’s ’cause of my shot. ‘Cause, boy, I coulda shot you anywhere. I coulda shot you on a wall, I coulda shot you on the ceiling. I could reach! I just gotta hold it and then, bow! I coulda shot you in the sink, right down the drain. I coulda back-handed you or shot you in your mama’s hair. I coulda shot you in her face, ’cause your mama like that type of shit, son. And it’s not that I’m upset. It’s that I’m hurt. Father’s Day come. The one fucking day that fathers get to be loved and appreciated. My daughter, she posts a picture of me, she writes me nine measly words. “Happy Father’s Day, Dad. You a good dude.” I said, “No, little gay b*tch. You a good dude.” But I gotta give it to her. At least she gave me some effort. She wrote words. My son, this little dickhead, he writes me three letters. #HFD. Y’all, I was so confused, I was like, “Houston Fire Department, what the fuck?” [Chuckles] It took me to Christmas to realize this jackass was saying “Happy Father’s Day.” And I don’t know what I did wrong. ‘Cause when you parent, there’s no proper formula. But I know I left one important ingredient out.',\n",
       "  ' I… didn’t spank my children. Um, all the sisters like, “Oh, you did what?” Send them motherfuckers to my house. I got you, boo. I’ll beat they ass and send them right back to you. No, I wo… I’ll put cocoa butter on they little scars “and send them right fucking back.” Spanking’s just some shit that we inherited from slavery. And all we doing is passing that damage down to our own children. White folks don’t do that. They talk to their kids. You see little kids in the supermarket throwing shit and shitting in fucking cereal boxes and… [Mock White voice] “Stop that, Jimmy. Jimmy, no, that’s not nice. You’re making me anxious, Jimmy.” [Normal voice] Nig? Black folks’ kid grab a cereal box, “I’ll kill ya, n*gga! Bap bap!” We gotta stop that shit, y’all. That’s some bullshit. And I remember the day that I was at that crossroad where I was gonna spank – where I… I… I chose not to spank my son or my kids. So, my son was 4 years old, and he had one of his buddies over at the house. Little badass kid. Little n*gga, name was like Tyrese or Tyrell. I think anything with a “Ty” in it… Tyrese, Tyrell, Ty-Ty, Tyrone, he gonna spend time in juvie at some point in his life. He a bad little n*gga. He had the cornrows, little tattoo on his neck and shit. And my son, they were… He playing… They were playing ball in the house. Boppity-boppity-boppity-bah. And you know, my children’s mother, she got all upset. She started nagging. “Shawn, stop playing ball in the house!” And you know kids, they don’t listen to their mother. Like, “Yeah, whatever, b*tch.” Boppity-boppity-boppity-bah. So she calls me in. “Marlon, I told Shawn to stop playing ball in the house and he ain’t listening!” So, you know, I hit him with the daddy voice. I said, [Deep voice] “Hey, hey, hey!” [Normal voice] Every n*gga with a father just… That’s what my son did. I said, [Deep voice] “Hey, hey, hey! Your mama says stop playing ball in the house, you stop playing ball in the house, you understand me?” [Normal voice] My son said, “Okay.” And then Tyrese, this little fatherless motherfucker. I say that ’cause he was immune to daddy voice. So I squeezed one of my balls to get the ball… To get the voice a little deeper. I said, [Deeper voice] “Hey, n*gga, I don’t care if I’m your daddy or not, you better stop playing ball in the Goddamn house before I kick your little ass.” [Normal voice] He said, “Man, you ain’t my daddy.” I said, “I see why your daddy left you, you little piece of shit.” And so he’s still dribbling the ball. I told my son, “Hey, you better not play.” He can do what the fuck he want, but you? You better listen to me.” My son said, “Okay.” So Tyrese is dribbling the ball. Bobbity-bobbity-bobbity-bop. Bobbity-bop. He crossing over. Bobbity-bop. Bobbity-bop. Through the legs. Bop-bop-bop. And he doing behind-the-back drills. Bop-bop. He playing ball so good, this shit looked fun. I want the n*gga to pass me the ball. So, at a point, my son looking at Tyrese, and he’s all impressed, and then he look at me. And he’d look back at Tyrese dribbling the ball. And he’d look at me. And he’d look at Tyrese dribbling the ball, and he’d look at Tyrese, he’d go, “Hey, Tyrese! Pass me the ball!” Man, I got so mad, I forgot my son was my son. Matter of fact, I forgot he was a kid, period. I talked to him like he was a grown-ass man. I said, “Man, are you out your motherfucking mind!” You know who the fuck I am, n*gga? You don’t know me, n*gga! Oh, fuck, I’ll fuck you up, boy! I’ll fuck you up! You don’t know me! You don’t know me, n*gga! My mama don’t know me, and I came out of her. You know who you fucking with? “I’ll fucking chuck your little ass!” And his mother ran to him, she said, “Marlon, what you doing?” I said, “B*tch, this your fault!” She said, “Put him down.” So I put his little ass down. She said, “What’s wrong with you?” I said, “I don’t know!” So she grabbed me, brought me to the bathroom. And I came out the door, said, “I’ma fuck you up, Shawn! And Tyrese, I’m fucking you up, too!” And that’s when Tyrese pulled out his knife, he said, “Yeah, n*gga, come on with it. Come on with it.” So Angela grabs me into the bathroom. And at this point, I’m fucking crying and I’m shaking. And she’s like, “What’s wrong with you?” I was like, “I don’t fucking know!” And I look in the mirror. And then my face morphs to me as a little boy. And I started thinking about all the ass-whoopings that my father gave me. And I started thinking about how much those ass-whoopings hurt. Not just my heart, but my ass. And I started thinking that every time my father hit me, it only made me further away from him. It made me distant from my father. I love my father now as a man, but as a kid, I didn’t love him. I feared him. Every time my father called my name… “Marlon!” Yo, my heart would beat fast, I’d piss my leg a little bit. My leg would get itchy, my ass would get small. My booty hole get nervous. Booty hole be looking over. [Silly voice] Oh, shit, you in trouble now. [Normal voice] And it got to the point where sometimes it wasn’t even for a spanking. For good shit, I’d get scared! “Marlon!” Ha! [Sobs] “Here, take this, go get some ice cre',\n",
       "  'am.” “Oh, my God, what kind of fucking mind trick is this?” Because what parents don’t realize, especially a father, you are your child’s superhero. So every time you hit your kid, it’s like Spider-Man made a web that was a belt and whooped his little ass. Like Superman took off his cape and made one of them little towels that you hit n*ggas in the ass in the locker room. Sh-pap! Sh-pap! That’s what it feels like! And so I chose not to hit my son. Instead, I sent him to bed. I said, “Go to bed! And don’t eat! Ever! N*gga, you better not ever eat again!” So 4:00 in the morning, I woke his little ass up. I said, “Shawn!” He got up all scared. I could hear his heartbeat. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. I could see a little pee dribbling down his leg. His little ass got tight. His little booty hole started talking to me. [Silly voice] Oh, shit, you in trouble now! [Normal voice] And my boy started crying, he said, “You gonna spank me? You just gonna spank me, Dad? You gonna spank me? I don’t care, you can spank me! I don’t care! You can spank me!” I said, “I ain’t gonna spank you.” Said, “I’ma talk to you.” And I sat him down. I said, “Let me tell you something. What you did yesterday…” I said, “You hurt my feelings.” And my son started crying, he said, “Oh, God, Dad. Don’t say that. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, Dad.” I said, “You broke the trust.” He said, “Oh, God, no!” Say it ain’t so! Say it ain’t so! [Sobs] I didn’t mean to break the trust, Dad. Not the trust! What’s trust? How much is it? “Can Mom buy some more trust on Amazon?” I said, “You disappointed me.” He said, “Oh, Dad, I didn’t mean [sobs] to ussapoint… you!” And I said to myself, “Oh, shit. White power words work!” So I started hitting him with all kind of White power words. I said, “Yes, and furthermore!” “No, Dad, don’t go no further!” “I… I… I’m appalled.” “No, Dad, don’t call Paul!” “And I’m exacerbated by your action!” “Oh, Dad, don’t masturbate on the actions!” I said, “So why would you listen to Tyrese over me?” He said, “I don’t know, Dad.” He said, “Shit, ’cause I was scared, Dad! I was scared!” I said, “Why? Of what?” He says, “Of Tyrese.” I said, “Why?” He said, “Dad, he got a outie belly button!” [Laughter] And you know what’s funny, man? Is I wanna blame my kids for our relationship, but that would be wrong of me, and that’d be immature. As a man, I gotta blame myself. I fucked up. Somewhere along the line, I fucked up. And I’ve been trying to trace my steps, like, “What did I do?” Did I spoil them? I knew I shouldn’t have never told them n*ggas I had money. I should have raised them in the projects. “They need more government cheese in their life.” [Chuckles] Or was it because I got caught cheating on their mother on a boat in St. Bart’s? I don’t think that’s it. I think it was spoiling them, I definitely think. I fucked up, man. I did. And I’ll tell y’all a story. Fuck it, you know? What had happened was… [Laughs] That’s how you know it was bad, when you, “Well, what had happened was…” Alright, uh, shit. Alright. Real talk. Alright, so years back, I did a movie called A Haunted House. And, yeah, it was really successful. Like this shit, I made it for a million dollars. It made like $100 million dollars worldwide. I made so much money, I felt like Jay-Z. I was like, “Yo, I’m going somewhere hot where there’s no mosquitos! Yeah!” I was like, “Yo, I’m going to St. Bart’s.” I’ma rent a yacht!” But see, Jay-Z is so smart, I see why this n*gga’s a billionaire. ‘Cause Jay-Z, he brings Beyoncé and them babies to St. Bart’s with him. Yeah, see, me, I fucked up. I brought a n*gga named Steve. I’m out in St. Bart’s, right? And I’m in the middle of the ocean. I don’t even know how paparazzi got my picture. We was in the middle of the fucking ocean with some girls on the boat. And I swear, paparazzi is sneaky. I was like, “Where the fuck were they?” Were they in a fucking dolphin, just…[Imitating dolphin] [Imitating camera shutter clicking] I didn’t know where they was! And so, I didn’t know until I got back to my hotel. I get back to my hotel, I’m feeling myself, got my shirt off, got the Coppertone tan. I’m like, “Yeah, we did that, Steve! Yeah, we did that.” And then my phone buzzed. [Makes buzzing sound] What the fuck is that? So I picked up the phone, and see, I put Google alerts on myself, ’cause as y’all see from this set, I say a lot of stupid shit, so I need to know the stupid shit I say, so I can call my publicist, so she can put the stupid shit I say, and say it was a lie, when it probably was the truth. [Laughs] I pick it up. “Paris Mail.” [French accent] “Marlon Wayans caught on the boat kissing the beautiful mademoiselle, or was this a mistress in St. Bart’s? Uh-oh!” [Normal voice] I put that phone down. I was like, “Oh, fuck! Fuck!” I was like, “Shit!” I was like, “Okay, Angie don’t know shit about France.” Okay, she don’t know shit about French at all. She calls Gucci ‘Gucky.’ She don’t know shit! She still think I bought her a ‘Channel’ bag for Christmas. Alright, so maybe I’ll go by the Louis ‘Vootton’ store and buy her a bag “just in case she does find out.” But I was like, “Alright, relax, relax.',\n",
       "  ' She don’t know no publications out the country. That’s some White shit.” So I put my phone down. Motherfucker buzzed again. [Makes buzzing noise] I pick it up. N*gga. “Bossip.” “Media Take Out.” “Shade Room.” “Essence” magazine. “Ebony” magazine. Everybody had the same title. “Marlon Wayans caught on boat in St. Bart’s, cheating on his children’s mother with a White b*tch!” [Chuckles] And I don’t know if y’all know Black culture, but look, it’s one thing to fuck a… fuck around, but you fuck around with White girls, sisters don’t like that shit too much. That’s why we be lying. N*ggas be like, “Oh, she wasn’t… she wasn’t White. She was mixed. Yeah, she was Swedish and Irish and German, but she wasn’t White, you know what I mean?” And sisters, you should have seen the articles. They was lighting me up. They was like, “I can’t believe this funny-looking n*gga had the nerve to cheat. I could see if it was Shawn, but not this bird-looking n*gga. He look like a ostrich that fell in some fucking oil. I can see if it was Damon, at least he’s funny. I wanna sit on his smushed-up face. But Marlon? He got some fucking nerve. Him and Nick Cannon need to go crawl “under the same rock and die.” I was like, “Oh, shit!” They’re like, “I can’t believe he got caught cheating with a White b*tch,” and I’m like, “Okay, sisters, if she was Black, would y’all be happier about that?” Like you pick up the thing and you see, “Oh, my God, I can’t believe Marlon Wayans got caught cheating. [Gasps] With a Black b*tch! That’s why I fucks with Marlon. I always like Marlon the best! “I did. He got big dick swag.” And so now, I start getting the phone calls. Paparazzi took so many pictures of me, my brothers find out shit about me they didn’t know I did. Phone rings. Keenen. [As Keenen] “Now, what’s up, little boy? How you doing? Mm, looks like you’re having a bad day. And when did you learn how to scuba dive?” [Normal voice] Hang up on him. Shawn. [As Shawn] “Hey, stupid! What are you doing, stupid?” What are you doing in the fucking ocean? You fucking drowned in a bathtub when we was fucking 8 years old, you fucking stupid. When did you learn how to Jet Ski? You crashed your fucking Big Wheel three times. “Why would you get a fucking Jet Ski, stupid?” [Normal voice] He hangs up the phone. Damon. [As Damon] “Hey, ugly, how you doing?” Mm. I’m doing better than you, that’s for sure. Hey, let me ask you something. When did you learn how to snorkel? “Mm-mm-mm.” [Normal voice] So then my children’s mother. [As Angie’s] “You stupid motherfucker. I can’t believe you got caught cheating! Can’t you be more discreet?” [Normal voice] I said, “Baby”, I was in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, 8,500 miles away. You gotta know the latitude and longitude of my dick “to catch me.” “Well, they caught your stupid ass. And look at you looking all stupid.” Women are funny. ‘Cause it wasn’t the kiss that she was mad about. She found the little shit. I said, “I know, I can’t believe I was sitting there kissing that girl, I’m so… I know it’s so embarrassing.” She said, “I don’t give a fuck about that little, pasty”, little b*tch with her little, thin-ass bologna lips, that scraggly-looking b*tch. Look at your stupid foot. Look at your stupid little foot. Look at that shit all pigeon-toed, bird foot motherfucker, looking like a old son… A fucking parrot twisted his ankle. Look how stupid your fucking foot look up in the air, “looking all stupid.” [Chuckles] She had me looking like, “Oh, shit, I am pigeon-toed. Ain’t that a b*tch.” And she goes, “I can’t believe you got caught cheating with a White b*tch!” I said, “Ang, she wasn’t White. She was mixed. She was Swedish and Irish and German, and… and I think she might have had been a little bit Nazi, but she wasn’t White, like, you’re tripping.” She hangs up the phone. Then my buddy Steve, he comes to the rescue. [As Steve] “Marlon, listen.” [Scoffs] All she got was pictures. Pictures are worth a thousand words. All you have to do is corroborate a story. We don’t know what happened in that picture. So here’s the story we’re gonna tell. We went in the middle of the ocean, and… and… and we went in a yacht, “and we saw some mermaids.” “And the mermaids was drowning.” Bloop-bloop-bloop. Bloop-bloop-bloop. And you, being the good Samaritan that you are, you jumped overboard, being a hero. You grabbed the mermaid to safety, and you brought her on board. And you wasn’t kissing her! No. No, no, no. “You was giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.” [Normal voice] I said, “N*gga, if you don’t get the fuck away” from me, I swear to God, I will wrap this anchor around your neck and put you in the bottom of this fucking ocean, “so help me God.” So now, I gotta go home, and I gotta face the music. And see, that day was the worst day of my life. That’s some shit that I’m gonna regret till my dying day. I’m gonna be in the coffin. They gonna close the lid, I’m like, “I’m sorry about the boat!” Because it’s one thing to break your woman’s heart. It’s another thing to break your kid’s heart. And I remember, I went to her house. I stop at my house, and I grab my Bible. Yeah, ’cause it’s really hard t',\n",
       "  \"o throw hot grits on a n*gga holding a Bible. And I walk up to the door, and I knock on the door. And she sees me holding the Bible, I said, “Bible study, my sister.” And she starts to laugh, because, you know, I… That’s the thing that she fell in love with. The fact that I have humor. I ain’t cute, so it’s definitely the humor. And she was like, “Don’t make me laugh.” Don’t… I fucking hate you. Don’t make me… Is that really a Bibl… Fuck it, I hate you. Don’t make me laugh!” And she hit me. I said, “Um, sister, it says ‘Thou shalt not kill.'” And she said, “Yeah, and it also says, ‘Thou shalt not fuck White b*tches in St. Bart’s.'” I said, “She wasn’t White. She was mixed.” [Laughs] And she’s like, “Get your ass in there.” And then [chuckles] she goes, “Go ahead. Talk to your kids.” I said, “Talk to the kids?” “Yeah, tell them what you did.” “Tell them what you did?” Fuck it. You got a page out the book “The Mack”? What the fuck? Stick yourself, Tony. Stick yourself. So she said, “No, talk to them.” I look at the table, and my kids are sitting at the table. My son, he looked like… He’s so sad, he looks like his pet turtle died. And my daughter, she’s sitting there holding her little naked dollies, just [humming] I said, “Hey, kids, how you doing?” Um, remember when Daddy said he wasn’t perfect? Well, there’s something on the Internet that proves that theory, so whatever you do, “don’t Google my name.” My daughter said, “Too late, Dad. Hmm. Can’t believe you got caught cheating on Mom. [Chuckles] With a White b*tch.” I said, “She wasn’t White. She was mixed! She was Swedish and Irish and German, and a little bit Aryan, but I don’t… I don’t think she was White.” And she goes, “Don’t worry, Dad. I accept you.” I said, “You do?” I said, “You forgive me?” She goes, “Yeah, I forgive you. And I accept you. But, you know, there’s gonna be some things you’re gonna have to accept about me, too, later on in life.” And she took her two little white dollies and put they pussies together. And I was like, “Okay.” And so, I said to my son, I said, “Son, do you forgive me?” He said, “Yeah, I forgive you, Dad.” But I’m really ussapointed. And furthermore, I think you should call Paul. And I need you to really masturbate on your actions, “’cause sh…” And I said, “I think I know what you mean. I’m sorry.” I said, “I love you, and I’ma make it up to you guys.” I promise. If I gotta spend the rest of my life making it up to you, I will. “And I love you.” And I gave them both kisses. [Smooches] And they said, “Okay.” And I went to walk off, and I was like, “Oh, thank God.” And my son said, “Hey, Dad?” I said, “Huh?” Said, “I got a few more questions.” I said, “You do? Okay, shoot, Tiger, what… What you got? You wanna know the weather in St. Bart’s? It’s hot, humid, you know, no mosquitos. It’s cool.” He said, “Mnh-mnh.” He said, “How many girls was on the boat?” Where did you meet these girls? How did they get there? Did you know them all? That one you was kissing, how do you know her? Where do you know her from? Did you fly her in? Did she fly first class? Did she fly coach? Or was she Delta Comfort? What’s this girl’s Instagram? “What’s her number? Do you love her?” I said, “Hey, n*gga, where you get these fucking questions from?” And I look over at his mother, who got a whole list of questions, and she’s checking them off. “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And don’t forget to ask if he wore a condom.” I said, “You wanna know the truth?” Fuck it. You wanna know the truth? I’ma tell you the fucking truth. Here’s the truth. The movie was very successful. I made a lot of fucking money, and I wanted to go somewhere hot where there was no mosquitos, so I went to St. Bart’s. And me and my boy rented a boat, and we went out to the middle of the ocean. And we saw some mermaids, “and they were drowning.” [Laughs] No, but re… [chuckles] real talk? You know, you gotta understand, fame is hard, man. I’ve been doing this shit for 30 years. And temptation is fucking real, man. Like, I could say “No” to a thousand girls. But, man, a thousand and one, sometimes they come with a thousand and two. And then they bring a thousand and three and four and… [Deep voice] You know what it is.

       " ['Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. The, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just',\n",
       "  ' don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just… This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.” I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I w',\n",
       "  'as like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good. So… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some',\n",
       "  ' kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.” As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full h',\n",
       "  'ouse? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.” So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.” The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I',\n",
       "  '’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.” You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!” So we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all',\n",
       "  ' see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.” So… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.',\n",
       "  '” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.” So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.” At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, ',\n",
       "  'I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was c',\n",
       "  'learly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.

       " ['Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is packed with Gervais‘ signature brand of sharp, often controversial humor, tackling topics like artificial intelligence, political correctness, family weddings, funerals, and, as the title suggests, the end of humanity. It’s a show for fans of his biting humor and willingness to push boundaries. If you’re easily offended or prefer more gentle comedy, it might not be your cup of tea. However, if you appreciate Gervais’ brand of dark humor and insightful observations, you’re likely to find plenty to laugh at, even if you cringe at times. Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is streaming on Netflix from December 25, 2023 * * * [audience chattering] [audience cheering and whistling] Hello. Thank you. [clears throat] Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thank you. [man 1] Whoo! No. Shh. That’s… You’ve… Thank you. [man 1 yells] No, you know the score. [man 1 yells] Shut the fuck up. [audience laughing] Thank you. Welcome to my new show. So new, in fact, it’s still evolving. I’ve got bits tonight I haven’t done before, right? [audience cheering] If I ad-lib, I haven’t even thought it before. And I have some terrible fucking thoughts. [audience laughing] But you can’t help that, can you? You can’t choose your thoughts. They just appear. It’s too late. You have a thought, and it goes, “I’m a thought.” And you go, “Oh fuck, I thought that.” [audience laughing] And then, sometimes, the thought will go, “Now say it.” [audience laughing] And I say it, and… Netflix. [audience laughing] My last show, SuperNature, dropped on Netflix last year. Um, big backlash, wasn’t there? [audience cheering] Big… Oh, big backlash. People going, “You can’t say that.” You can. You can. [audience laughing] I did. Um… [audience cheering and whistling] Yeah, the inevitable backlash, which made it the most-watched special of the year, so… [audience laughing] I’ve learned my lesson. Um… [audience laughing] No, I have learned my lesson, and that’s why I’m going to be woke from now on. [audience laughing and booing] It’s about time. Well, I’m sorry. Well, I am woke. And now I’m woke, the first thing I’ve gotta do is change my Twitter bio. ‘Cause at the moment, it’s, like, a list of the shows I’ve created. But now I’m woke, I’ve gotta pop in the word “anti-fascist”… [audience laughing] …so people know I’m not a fascist, ’cause that is a big problem at the moment. Um… People come up to you and go, “Rick, have you been imprisoning journalists?” I go, “No.” They go, “Oh, interesting.” [audience laughing] They go, “Have you been gassing Jews?” I go, “No.” They go, “Pop it in your bio then, you silly cunt.” [audience laughing] [scattered applause] So, yeah, I’m not a fascist. It’s an odd thing to declare, isn’t it, that you’re not a fascist? We assume, don’t we? You wouldn’t go up to someone in the street and do that, would you? “Oh, by the way, I’m not a fascist.” You know? [audience laughing] It’s like they protest too much. It’s like going into a school and going, “I’m not a pedo.” “So just forget I even mentioned it.” [audience laughing] “These kids are safe running around me. Don’t worry.” [laughs] “They can run around naked for all I care.” “I’m not a pedo, so…” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “fascist” has changed. Traditionally, the word “fascist” meant a member of a far-right authoritarian regime that uses militarism and violence to suppress individual rights. Now the word “fascist” can mean “liked a Joe Rogan tweet.” So… [audience laughing] …words change, yeah? And that’s part of the reason I’m gonna become woke. Words change, and I don’t wanna be left behind, you know. I don’t wanna end up like my granddad in the ’70s. Oh. He was all like, “coloreds” this and “queers” that. [groans] Although the word “queer” is all right again now, so… If you wait long enough, it just goes full circle. Just… [audience laughing] Just be patient is my ad… [audience laughing] So, yeah, you can… you can use the word “queer” now. You still can’t use it as a noun, only as an adjective. You can’t go up to someone and go, “You’re a queer,” but you can go, “Hear about Darren? He’s queer now.” [audience laughing] If Darren is definitely bent. [audience laughing] You can’t go around just slagging off Darren willy-nilly. Do you know what I mean? You can… You can get sued in this country for saying someone’s gay if they’re not, you know, which is a homophobic law, ’cause you can’t be sued the other way around. You can’t be sued for saying someone’s not gay if they are, which seems unfair, doesn’t it? Like, I could go up to Britain’s biggest gay and go, “All right, Elton.” All right? And… [audience laughing] He’d love that. He’d fucking love that. If that’s your game, you wanna be top of the pile, so to speak. Right? [laughs] [audience laughing] I’d go, “All right, Elton?” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, ♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪\\n♪ Ha-ha You’re not a gay ♪ [audience laughing] He’d go, “I bloody am.” All right? He’d go, “I’m gonna sue you.” I’d go, “You can’t. You can’t.” [audience laughing] He’d go, “But know that I am gay.” I go, “I don’t believe you are.” He’d go, “Come home with me and see the shit I do if you don’t believe me.” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “queer” has changed. Again, traditionally, the word “queer” used to mean uh, someone who was attracted to the same sex as themselves. A gay man, all right? Now, the word “queer” can mean a straight man who wants some attention. [audience laughing] “I’m all queer. I’m all queer now.” “Are you?” “Yeah, I’m ri… I’m…” “I’m right queer now, I am.” [audience laughing] “Are you?” “Yeah.” “What about your girlfriend?” “Yeah, she’s queer and all. We’re just…” [audience laughing] “We’re just two queers queering each other up.” [audience laughing] “Suck a cock.” “Nah.” [audience laughing] “No, didn’t think so.” “I’m not that sort of queer.” [groans] “What sort of a queer are you?” “Dyed my hair blue.” [audience laughing] “So did my grandmother and she fucking loved cock.” “So, what… What are we saying?” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping and cheering] I have no ev',\n",
       "  \"idence for that. [audience laughing] We… We never had that conversation. [man 2 yells] [Gervais laughs] So words change is my point. Like the word “handicapped.” All right? Again, traditionally, that was the politically correct term, the all-inclusive term for cripples and shit, right? Uh… [audience laughing] But then, they went, “No, we wanna be disabled.” They didn’t wanna be disabled. They said… [audience laughing] [laughs] They said… They said… [laughs] They said, “We wanna be referred to as ‘disabled.'” “We don’t like the term ‘handicapped’ anymore.” “Stop using it. Say ‘disabled.'” We went, “Fine.” And that’s great. Just tell me the rules and I’ll… In fact, I’m a stickler for the rules. Like, if I was on a beach and a woman came running and went, “Help! Help! My handicapped toddler’s drowning!” I’d go, “Sorry your what, love? What?” [audience laughing] “My handicapped toddler’s drowning, and he can’t swim.” “Whoa. Do you mean your disabled toddler is drowning?” “Yeah.” I go, “Right. Well, let’s… Oh, dead.” [audience laughing] Dead. Wasted too much time being woke, didn’t I? [audience laughing] Well, I am woke now, and I can prove it. Here you go. I love illegal immigrants. Yeah, sue me. Sometimes I go down to Dover for the day, right? And I… I look out, right? I look out. I look for a boat, and I see a dinghy with about 60 of ’em. And I go, “Over here.” Like that, right? [audience laughing] And I pull ’em in. I pull ’em into shore. And I go, “Women and children first.” They go, “There are no women and chil…” “Just you lads, is it? Come on, lads.” [audience laughing and clapping] [woman 1] Whoo! If I go down there and there’s no boat, I am absolutely fucking gutted. I don’t… [audience laughing] I just sort of wander into town, and, uh, I stand by the traffic lights, and I wait for a big lorry to pull up, right? And I look underneath, and there’s a lad sort of clutching like that. And I go, “Where you headed?” He goes, “Gary Lineker’s house.” I go, “It’s just down there.” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Yeah. Fuck borders. Fuck… We don’t need borders, do we? Be like the Vikings. They didn’t care about borders, did they? I’ve got a little bit of Viking blood in me. Well, we all have, ’cause of all the raping they did. [audience laughing] They say it was raping and pillaging, but I think it was mainly for the raping. I think they added the pillaging bit for the wives. Know what I mean? They went down and went, “We’re off to Great Britain.” “Oh, why?” “Just a bit of pillaging.” [audience laughing] “Just pillaging?” “Just pillaging, babe.” [audience laughing] “All right. Why are you wearing your rape hat?” [audience laughing] So this show is called Armageddon, and it’s all about how I think humanity might end, ’cause there’s a long list of possibilities, you know? We’re on a precipice, you know. Um, it could be, uh, anything from global warming, the rise of the… the pandemic, you know. Um, nuclear war, our own stupidity, basically. ‘Cause we are getting more stupid as a species. No doubt about that. You can now do a university degree course in Taylor Swift. How fucking low, academically, can you go? There’s an institute in London called the School of Flower Arranging. I went past it. I couldn’t believe it. “School of Flower Arra…” I looked in, and there’s people having lectures. Flower arranging! My mum used to pick flowers every day from the garden, cut flowers, put ’em in vases around the house. At no point did anyone come around and go, “What unqualified cunt did these?” [audience laughing] Uh, yeah, the Earth is in a terrible mess, and it’s my fault. My generation’s fault. And the generation before, the Boomers, with their deforestation and their fossil fuels, ruining the ozone layer, raising the temperature by a few degrees. So parasites, you know, bacteria, and the zootrophic pandemics are just gonna get worse and worse. Like, if you’re 20 years old now, you’re gonna have a very different middle age to me. I’ve had the best 60 years of civilization. But if you’re 20 now, in 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be in your house, wearing a mask… crying. [audience laughing] Like you do now over jokes. [audience laughing] [audience clapping and cheering] And I’m not gonna be around to see that, but I am gonna spend my entire fortune, from now on, on private jets to make sure it definitely fucking happens. [audience laughing] [woman 2] Whoo! [man 3] Yeah, Ricky! We’re gonna be the first generation that future generations are jealous of, right? ‘Cause we had it all, and we’re using it all up. We’re using up all the fresh water. We’re using up all the fossil fuel. Usually, you look back in history and you feel sorry. You go, “Oh, how did they live like that? Oh, how did they get around?” “No indoor toilets.” I’ve got nine toilets in my house. [audience laughing] Um… And sometimes, I just run around flushing ’em for a laugh. Like that. [audience laughing] Just so that in 40 years’ time, Greta Thunberg has to shit out of a window. [audience laughing] I’ve got 28 radiators. I always have them on full. Then I put the air con on full, and it sort of settles at about 20 degrees. A lovely… It’s how the cat likes it. She loves it at 20 degrees. And I… I spoil my cat. Um… I love cats. I love having a cat. Thing about… Cats are great, but if you let ’em out, they bring home the most disgusting things. Last week, mine brought home a Scouser with herpes. [audience laughing] And it wasn’t quite dead, so I had to get it by its legs and crack its head against the table. [audience laughing] Ugh. [clicks tongue] And who cares? If humanity was wiped out today, the Earth would return to a paradise in a few hundred years. If we lose bees, we’re a desert, forever. We’re not that important. We’re just one species of narcissistic ape. And some people on social media get annoyed when I say we’re apes. You know, religious types, Americans. Um… [audience laughing] One bloke said to me, “Speak for yourself, dude. I ain’t no ape.” And I sent back, “Well, you are, ’cause we’re all apes.” He went, “Nah. What’s a gor\",\n",
       "  'illa ever done?” “We’ve walked on the moon.” I sent back, “What do you mean, ‘we’? You’ve done fuck all.” [audience laughing] “You’ve spelled ‘moon’ wrong.” [audience laughing] It’s weird, isn’t it, when people take credit for the sort of rest of the species. ‘Cause that’s what’s pushed civilization forward, you know, a few geniuses along the way. Like, there’s eight billion people on this planet. Most of us do nothing. We eat, shit, and die. Like, if there was a meteor heading towards Earth that’d definitely destroy it, four billion people would get down on their knees and pray to their particular god, and a few hundred scientists would work out how to get Bruce Willis up there to stop it. [audience laughing] It’s an odd concept, praying, for me. I can’t work out how God decides. All those people praying at once for different things. Is it like best idea wins, or is it a democracy? Like, he puts things… Each issue, he goes, “Right, votes for and against,” you know. If it’s a democracy, we’re in trouble. We’re a tiny nation. Like, next time there’s a flood warning in the West Country, if we’re all going, “Oh, I hope everyone’s okay,” if the whole of China is going, “Yeah, fuck Bristol…” [audience laughing] There’s a billion of them. Know what I mean? More about China later. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’ve always, uh, found praying quite strange. Like, if I bump into a friend or neighbor, and I know they’ve got a little kid, and I go, “Oh, how’s so-and-so?” And they go, “Oh, not good. Um, he’s in intensive care.” “We don’t know if he’s gonna pull through, but I pray every night.” What I do as an experiment… [inhales sharply] [audience laughing] I go home, and I pray twice that he doesn’t make it. [audience laughing] [man 4] Oh… I don’t do that. [audience laughing] On a serious note, um, I’ve been doing a lot of video messages recently for terminally-ill children. And, um… Only if they request it, obviously. I don’t… [audience laughing] I don’t burst into hospitals and go, “Wake up, baldy.” [audience laughing] “Look, me twerking on TikTok. Look.” [audience laughing] No, um, I did a lot through the pandemic. Presumably, ’cause they couldn’t even see their own family. And, uh… It’s through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Do you know the charity? They’re great, and they give these dying kids their one wish. And if it’s me, I always say yes, and I always start the video the same way. I go, “Why didn’t you wish to get better?” [audience laughing] “What, you fucking retarded as well?” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughs] I don’t do that either, okay? [audience laughing] These are all jokes, okay? [laughs] In fact, I don’t even use that word in real life, the r-word. “You just used it.” “Yeah, in a joke.” “That’s not real life, is it? I’m playing a role.” “You sounded pretty convincing.” “Yeah, ’cause I’m good.” [audience laughing] You wouldn’t level the accusation at other art forms. You wouldn’t go up to Sir Anthony Hopkins and go, “I saw you in Silence of the Lambs.” “What, so, you a cannibal, are you?” “No, I… I was playing a role.” “Oh.” “Mm, seemed pretty convincing.” Yeah. [audience laughing] He’s good, and I’m good, and that’s why I do things well. Imagine if I came out and did things not very well, so you knew I was joking. That’d be fucking retarded. [audience laughing] Has anyone bothered asking the dolphins if they mind swimming with dying kids? Know what I mean? ‘Cause that can’t be fun for… They’re, like, flipping around, then suddenly someone dumps a truckload of pale teenagers flailing… [audience laughing] The dolphin’s like, “What the fuck is this? What the fuck’s this? Oh, fucking hell.” [groans] Oh, let him do it.” “What the fuck?” “They’re all… They’re all dying.” “Of what? That one just stuck his fingers in my fucking blowhole.” [audience laughing] “He’s not gonna be around for long.” “Nor am I if I can’t fucking breathe.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] It’s very sad, um, but we all die. We all know we’re gonna die, and we all do die, so it doesn’t really matter if we die one at a time along the way, or all at once, in one big final Armageddon. The result is, we’re all gonna be dead one day, and we’re all gonna be dead forever. And I’ve been to a lot of funerals in my time. You live this long, you know a lot of people, they die, right? And I don’t mind funerals, ’cause it’s the end. You know what I mean? I hate weddings. Oh, fucking… [audience laughing] It’s all… There’s so much hope. You know what I mean? And they’re needy and arrogant. They go, “Oh, we’re getting…” “Do you wanna come and watch us for 12 hours?” “No. Fuck, no.” [audience laughing] Even the invite is arrogant, isn’t it? It’s like a royal decree. “You are cordially invited…” It’s not a fucking honor. I don’t wanna go to your shitty wedding. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And then you go, “Oh, right, yeah. When is it?” They go, “Two years’ time.” They know you haven’t got an excuse for two years’ time. [audience laughing] So you just have to hope that one of ’em dies. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And so you go, “Oh, yeah, I’ll be there. Yeah, yeah. Where is it?” They go, “India.” “Oh, fuck off!” [audience laughing] I’m not having injections for you, you boring bastards. [audience laughing] And I’ve got a big family now, a big extended family. There’s always one getting married. They know I’ve got a bit of cash. So I can’t give ’em a tea set anymore. I’ve gotta get ’em their first fucking house. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] I’ve got a big family. I had older brothers and sisters. They all had loads of kids, and their kids have loads of kids, and their kids have had loads of kids, ’cause we’re chavs, basically. [audience laughing] There’s a new baby every Christmas. It’s one of those families. I go home, it’s crowded. I go, “Oh. Oh, whose is that?” “Oh, yours. Well done.” I don’t know him, I don’t know her. You know what I mean? It’s like… But what I’ve done over the last couple of years, I’ve got ’em each and individually, right, in private, and I’ve told them that I’m leaving my e',\n",
       "  'ntire fortune to just them, right? [audience laughing] But to keep it secret. So they all love me, right? And I’m not doing a will, so my funeral is gonna be a fucking bloodbath. [audience laughing] I’m at that age now where people ask me what I’ve got planned for my funeral. Even journalists say, “How… What’s your funeral…” I go, “I haven’t planned it.” “No?” “No, it’s depressing.” “Also, I don’t care. I’ll be dead.” They go, “Don’t care about what people think of you?” “No, I’ll be dead.” They go, “What about your legacy?” “Fuck my legacy.” You can’t plan your legacy. I think of all these people who died thinking they’d be loved forever. Eminent people going, “There is a statue of me in the town square.” And now, they’re pulling down the statues. “Pull down this fucking statue.” “Why?” “He was a slave trader. Pull down the fucking statue.” “He built the hospital. Should we pull that down?” “No, leave the hospital.” [audience laughing] “Just pull down the fucking statue.” [audience cheering and whistling] “Pull down the statue and dump it in the canal.” “He built the canal.” “Doesn’t matter. Just pull down the fucking statue.” I don’t think you should whitewash history. If you find out summat new, add to it. Like, if there’s a statue, and it’s got, “Lord Whimsy. Trader, philanthropist.” Add, “a bit racist.” [audience laughing] Or one of those blue plaques on a house that goes, “Sir Robert Spewk lived here.” “Author, poet, pedo.” [audience laughing] I think we live too long. That’s why we have time to worry about all this. We’re not meant to live this long. Uh, as a species, we’re about 300,000 years old, as Homo sapiens. We’ve been around as hominids for a few million years, and, of course, along with every other life-form that exists at the moment, we’ve been evolving for three and a half billion years. Everything that exists at the moment all came from the same little blob of organic matter three and a half billion years ago. That’s why it annoys me when people say, “Oh, yeah, humans, we’re the most evolved.” We’re not the most evolved. We’re no more evolved than the slug or the snail. People go, “Come on, look at ’em.” Yeah, they got it right early doors. Nature keeps testing ’em. “Do you want eyes?” “No.” [audience laughing] “Not really. No. No.” I have noticed one thing about the slug and the snail. Let’s not split hairs. Let’s be honest. The snail is basically a slug with a shell on it, isn’t it? Right? But if you pull the shell off the snail, it starts giving it all… [groans] [audience laughing] “Oh, I’m dying. I’m dying.” And the slug is like, “Welcome to the real world, cunt.” Know what I mean? [audience laughing] So, yeah, we’ve been around for about 300,000 years. And for most of that time, we had the same life expectancy as every other wild ape. Thirty-five, 40, if you’re lucky. You’re born, you grow, you mate, you’re playing with your kids, you get a cut, you go, “What’s that?” Dead. [audience laughing] But now, with antibiotics and medicine, we’ve pushed that forward. A child born today can expect to live to about 100. And scientists said soon that’ll be about 120. And science also said that, in the near future, there’s no reason, with proper care and attention, that human beings won’t regularly live to 150 years old. Which is amazing, until you remember that we get a set number of brain cells, which we only lose. You can’t get them back. So, in the future, there’s gonna be 15 billion people on the planet. You know? Half of them are gonna be over 100, and they’re all gonna have Alzheimer’s. It’s gonna be like Dawn of the Dead. It’s gonna be fucking horrible. [audience laughing] You know? My auntie died of Alzheimer’s. Um, I don’t know how you die of Alzheimer’s. She forgot to live. Right? [audience laughing] And for the last couple of years, she was in a home, and, uh, my cousin, her only kid, used to visit her, like, once a week. And it got more and more depressing, ’cause soon she didn’t recognize him, and then she didn’t know who she was, or… and then she died. And at the funeral, we were sort of reminiscing about the good days. Some of the funny, absent-minded things she said and did. Then we realized, oh, probably, that was the beginning of the disease before it was diagnosed. And this is a true story. Once, my cousin went home from work, and he went in, and she went, “Your tea’s in the oven. I’ve had mine already.” He went, “Oh, cheers, Mum.” And he… It was like a fish pie, right? He ate the fish pie, then he went, “Oh God. Ooh.” He ran upstairs… [imitates retching] Vomited. Went back down and went, “Mum, the fish is off. I’ve just been really sick.” And she said, “Yeah, it made me really sick.” [audience laughing] I’ve been looking into infant mortality rates recently. Um… [audience murmuring] For research. Not… It’s not a fucking fetish. Like… [audience laughing] A child born today in the UK has a percentage chance of survival of 99.8%, which is incredible. I thought, “Is that just the mollycoddled West?” I was putting in Third World countries. And even in Africa, it’s like 96.5%. In the wilds of Africa, where everything wants to fucking eat a newborn baby. Babies are vulnerable enough, aren’t they? In Africa, a baby can be born in a mud hut. There’s a lion outside. It’s covered in blood. They can’t wash it. They’ve got no water. Ooh, and it’s already got AIDS. [audience laughing] Now… by the time that joke goes on Netflix… [audience laughing] …it’ll be nuanced. There’ll be an underlying satirical point, I’ll claim. [audience laughing] But, until then, all I’ve got is, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” [audience laughing] I know that it’s funny. I just have to work out why. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. Also, by the time that goes on Netflix, I’ll have been playing arenas around the world. It’ll be hitting hard. People will be laughing. So if you are an African woman, and you… you just had a baby in Africa, and the doctor goes, “Oh, I’m sorry, your baby’s got AIDS.” You go, “Oh my God.” You’re there… Baby’s got… You’re there with your husband, and you go, “',\n",
       "  'Our baby’s got AIDS, Jeff.” Jeff… [laughs] [audience laughing] [laughing] “I know, Tracy. I’ve got it too.” [imitates extinguishing cigarette] [audience laughing] [laughs] “Our baby’s got AIDS. Should we watch some comedy to cheer us up?” “Yeah. What, Netflix?” “Yeah.” “What, Ricky Gervais?” “Duh.” “Yeah.” [audience laughing] And they’re… they’re sad that their baby’s got AIDS, but they’re sort of laughing along. “Ha-ha. Armageddon. Ha-ha.” And it gets to that bit, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” And she goes, “Oh my God. Jeff, why… why are they all laughing at us and our baby with AIDS?” And Jeff goes, “Well, they’re not laughing at us per se.” She goes, “Well, they are. They’ve named us and everything.” “They’re literally laughing at us in this bit.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] And Jeff goes, “Yeah, but we’re a fictional couple with a fictional baby with AIDS.” “Anyone offended by that is a fucking moron.” [audience laughing] And then, he goes, “And at least he didn’t do the accent.” So… [audience laughing] And she goes, “Yeah, but only because Jane begged him not to.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] It’s funny ’cause it’s true. [audience clapping and cheering] I think we get our sense of humor from our parents, whether we realize it or not. Particularly working-class kids. Particularly from working-class mums. ‘Cause they’re busy. They’re doing everything. They’re keeping men in check, they’re bringing up kids, they’re going to work, they’re saving the world. They haven’t got time. They have to frighten their kids into behaving well. They have to go to dark places to shock them into not fucking dying. Do you know what I mean? So… Like, if I was little, and my mum made my tea, and it wasn’t my favorite, it was boiled potatoes, instead of chips every day, and I went, “I don’t like them,” my mum would go straight to, “Of course you do.” “There’s children your age in Africa and they’re starving to death.” Right? I’d go, “Jesus. All right.” You know what I mean? Ju… [snapping fingers] True story. I was seven years old, right, and I’d been playing in the park. And I came running in, and my mum went, “Ricky, come here. Sit down.” There must’ve been a local pedo incident, all right? [audience laughing] And my mum went, “Never go in the toilets in the park again.” And I went, “Why?” She knew she couldn’t explain pedophilia to a seven-year-old, right? But this is what she came up with. She said, “Because there’s a man going around, and he’s cutting little boys’ willies off.” [audience laughing] I was like… “What, that’s a fucking thing, is it? That’s a…” I didn’t sleep for a week. Uh… [audience laughing] And it worked. I never went in those fucking toilets again. But she knew, instinctively. If she’d gone, “Ricky, come in. Sit down.” “What’s the matter?” “Never go in the toilets again.” “Why not?” “There’s a pedophile.” “What’s a pedophile?” “Oh, he’s a man who gives you sweets and puppies.” “Bring it on!” You know what I mean? [audience laughing] Me… At seven years old? I’d wank off anyone for a puppy. [audience laughing] It’d be like that, wouldn’t it? It’d be like that. [audience laughing] I’m gonna get a puppy. [audience laughing] Hi. I’m getting a puppy. I’m getting a puppy. Gonna get a puppy. Oh, fucking hell. [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t… I cannot do it left-handed at all. [audience laughing] Fucking hell, come on. Have you been drinking? [audience laughing] Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on! [audience laughing] Fucking hell. Oh. [Gervais laughing] I’ve started, so I’ll finish. [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] Oh. Oh, fuck me. Oh. What sort of puppy is it? [audience laughing] A what? A Labrador? [audience laughing] Throw in a kitten, and I’ll give you a blow job. [laughs] I go back. Kitten, puppy, cum. [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh… I miss the local pedo. [audience laughing] Don’t you? There was always one, wasn’t there? Outside school, you’d be with your mum, and she’d go, “Look, there’s a pedophile.” ‘Cause he had the uniform of the pedo. You know what I mean? You could spot… Old bloke, bald on top, long down the side. Like that. And I’ll go, “That’s a dirty p…” “Say hello.” “Hello.” Like that. Dirty look. That’s what a fucking pedo looks… Dirty fucking pedophile, right? That’s what he’d look… If he touches you, we’ll burn his house down. It was a good system. Know what I mean? But then Michael Jackson comes along, and he breaks the mold, doesn’t he? ‘Cause he’s… he’s not an ugly bloke outside the school. I’m not saying Michael Jackson definitely was a pedophile. No one knows. Only Michael and all those people he paid off. All I’m saying is… [audience laughing] [woman 3] Yes! …that kids loved Michael. They… Kids loved Michael just to look at him. Like a little Disney cartoon, wasn’t he? And then his voice, “Hello.” You know, that… [audience laughing] Oh. Michael Jackson would go up to any kid he wanted. Probably went up to them like that, didn’t he? Like that. [audience laughing] That’s another thing. Kids would go, “There’s Michael Jackson. He’s going away from us.” He wasn’t. He was going towards them. [audience laughing] But people don’t care, ’cause he’s so good. Right? He’s so good. He’s so popular as well. I think if he’d have lived to stand trial, he’d have beaten the rap, ’cause everyone loves him, and he’d be so vulnerable in court as well, wouldn’t he? He’d be there like that, and the judge would go, “Michael, did you fiddle with all those kids?” And he’d go, “Hee, hee.” [audience laughing] The judge would go, “Case di… Get out of here, you scamp. Go on.” [audience laughing] I promised you more about China, and this is, uh, an amazing statistic, okay? This is true. Look it up, right? In China, there are ten million Chinese pedophiles. Ten million Chinese pedophiles in China, and there’s not enough kids. ‘Cause they’ve been restricting the birth. There’s all these poor pedos and they’re going, “Where’s all the fucking kids?” You know? [audience laughing] “Fuck me.” [audience yelling] “We’re having to double up here, and, like…” I just thought of a joke then. I c',\n",
       "  'an’t do it. It is actually too offensive. [laughs] Okay. Okay. All right. [audience cheering] All right, I’ll do it. But… But remember, remember, you can’t choose your own thoughts, okay? [audience laughing] And I just had this thought, right? [laughs] [audience yelling] Chi… Okay. Chinese pedophile… Chinese pedophile goes over to a little Chinese kid, and he goes, “Do you want a puppy?” And the kid goes, “I’m not hungry.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [audience cheering] You made me do that. [audience laughing] You committed the hate crime. [audience laughing] I’m woke. I forgot. Let me get back on track. Right. [audience laughing] Right, I’ve got a woke joke. Remember those jokes we used to have when we were kids? “Doctor, Doctor” jokes? Like, um, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” “Well, pull yourself together, then.” Right? I’ve… I’ve done a woke version of that, brought it up to today’s standards. Bloke goes to the doctor. He goes, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” And the doctor goes, “Well, you are, then.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Good one that, innit? I should do political stuff now I’m woke, but I don’t like it when a comedian just spouts his own political views, and it… and it relies on the audience agreeing with him to get a round of applause. I think that loses summat comedically. I want everyone to like my jokes, whatever your political persuasion. A joke shouldn’t have a political wing, you know. I’m… I’m political in my private life, like everyone, you know. I’m sometimes incensed by the inequalities in our society. We’re in the seventh richest economy in the world, right, and there’s homelessness. There’s 250,000 homeless people in Britain. Now, I wish there were no homeless people, ’cause they’re fucking horrible. [audience laughing] Fuck off. You know? Oh… “Oh yeah, right next to the cashpoint, you cheeky cunt.” [audience laughing] It is a serious problem, and I hope none of you ever find yourself homeless, but if you do, my advice is heroin. [audience laughing] Cheers you right up, apparently. Um, I’ve got one of those mates. My mate said this to me in all seriousness. He said, “Yeah.” He said, “But the thing about heroin, Rick,” he said, “Some of the greatest albums of all time were created on heroin, weren’t they?” I went, “Yeah, but they were created by some of the greatest artists of all time.” “You’re a plasterer.” Right? [audience laughing] “If I were to give you heroin, you wouldn’t come up with Dark Side of the Moon, would ya?” “You’d fall asleep watching the telly and burn the fucking house down.” [audience laughing] I should do, uh, topical stuff, but I never watch the news. I did see one thing recently on YouTube actually. Do you know the little fellow from Game of Thrones? Um, the actor Peter Dinklage. Do you know Peter Dinklage? Yeah. He was at a junket, and it was for a new thing he was doing, right? And they were filming it. That’s why it got leaked onto YouTube. And I don’t know what brought it up, but he suddenly started going off on one. Oh God. He was going, “It’s fucking disgusting.” “They’re still doing productions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” “For Christ’s sake! It’s fucking demeaning. It’s 2023!” [inhales deeply] He wasn’t happy. [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [woman 4 yelling] He was grumpy, wasn’t he? [audience laughing] [woman 5 yelling] [audience clapping] He’s got a point though, hasn’t he? Obviously, he’s got a point. But the thing is, it’s all right for him, ’cause he’s a multi-millionaire Hollywood actor. And he’s a great actor as well. He does Shakespeare and everything. A lot of dwarfs in entertainment aren’t that great, if we’re… No, some of them are fucking… They’re props, right? [audience laughing] No, let’s be… They’re… They’re lucky to be fired from a fucking cannon. Right? [audience laughing] And so, dancing around Snow White for three weeks of the year, that is their Holy Grail, and he’s gonna fuck it for them. If he takes that, what can they do? And he’s not saying, “You should do Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with normal-sized actors.” You can’t do that either. You’d get in trouble in Hollywood. Or you can’t take a dwarf’s job or a disabled person’s job. Like, Eddie Redmayne got in trouble when he played Stephen Hawking in the biopic. The life story of Stephen Hawking, right? Won an Oscar for it. And that’s when the backlash started. People going, “No, it should be played by a real disabled creature.” All this… [babbles] All right? And, uh… [babbles] And… [catches breath] They’re going, “The actor should have the same disability as the person they’re portraying.” But it was the life story of Stephen Hawking, right? So for the first part of the film, the cunt could walk, right? [audience laughing] So I put it to you, what is easier? Getting an actor who can walk… [audience laughing] …pretend he can’t for the last bit of the film, or get an actor who can’t walk, pretend he can for the first bit? How would that even fucking work?! Puppetry? Think! [audience laughing and clapping] You can’t always find an actor with the same disability as the person they’re portraying. They’re fucking actors! What if they did a biopic of Helen Keller, the deaf, dumb, and blind girl? What’s the chance of finding a deaf, dumb, and blind actress who can play that role? And if you did, you’d go running to the director. “We found a deaf, dumb, and blind girl.” “What did she say?” “N… I…” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] “She didn’t even answer the fucking phone.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh, don’t get me started. Oh. Oh. Cultural appropriation. Have you heard of that? Cultural appropriation, the latest no-no. Now, again, in my day, it was considered a good thing to swap ideas with other cultures, with other nations, to share things with other races, to assimilate. It was the opposite of racist. Now it’s racist. Gwen Stefani got in trouble in her last video ’cause she had her blonde hair in dreadlocks. People were going, “No. Black people invented dreadl',\n",
       "  'ocks.” “You can’t have ’em. You’re white. That’s racist.” Jamie Oliver got in trouble when he put out an authentic jerk chicken recipe. “No. Black people invented that.” “You can’t have it. You’re white. That’s racist.” Now, Black people, they use the n-word, don’t they? We invented that! [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughter continues] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping] That’s the one, innit? That’s the one. [audience laughing] Listen, I know white people are the worst. I know that. That’s why no… no one likes a fucking white, middle-aged man anymore, until we need a boiler fixing. Then it’s, “Get the bald bloke around. Now.” [audience laughing] Critical race theory, have you heard of that? Being taught in schools now, particularly in trendy areas like L.A., to, like, five-year-old kids and six-year-old kids. If you haven’t heard of it, in a nutshell, critical race theory says that all white people are racist. We’re born racist, and we continue to be racist, ’cause we’re affording the privilege of a racist society set up by our forefathers. Okay? So basically, all white people are racist, and there’s nothing we can do about it, which is a relief. Um… [audience laughing] I think the world’s gonna get harder and harder to understand as I get older and more bewildered. A new dogma arises in the name of “progress.” Now, dogma is never progressive, however new and trendy. But I think soon I’ll be outnumbered. Like, it was only this year that I ordered my first item off Amazon. All the way through the pandemic, Jane’s like, “We need this.” Bang, it’s here. I was going, “Oh no.” She goes, “It’s easy.” I’d go, “Mm.” I never liked real shopping either. Hated real shopping. Particularly, clothes shopping. I hated clothes shopping when I was young and thin. I really hate it now I’m fat and old. Right? Once, a shop assistant thought I had my inside leg and my waist measurement the wrong way round. [audience laughing] I could see her thinking, “Do you have an orangutan?” “No, it’s for me, you cheeky…” [audience laughing] I never liked real shopping, but I don’t trust the Internet either. Jane was going, “Just put in your credit card.” “I don’t want them to have my card details.” “Everyone’s got your card details. Put the number in.” I went, “What one?” She went, “The long one.” She went, “Oh, fuck me, give it here. There. You’re on. Order summat.” I thought, “Oh, I don’t want anything. Oh, tracksuit bottoms.” You can’t have too many. I wear mine till the bollocks fall out, all right? [audience laughing] So I put in, “Men’s tracksuit bottoms. Black. Zip pockets.” About 38… “Oh, fuck me.” “They look all right.” Size chart. I go, “Well, they’d be a bit long, but they’d be a bit tight.” I thought, “9.99. Fuck it, who cares, right?” [audience laughing] So I ordered them. They came the next day. I opened them up. They were shit. Now, I don’t know what sweat shop they were made in, or what little eight-year-old Chinese kid made them, but he should be fucking punished, because the… Ah. [audience laughing] Oh. And I was looking up where to fucking complain to get him fired, right? [audience laughing] And I found out that these kids only get two dollars a day in these fucking places, right? But what happened to pride in your work? Do you know what I mean? [audience laughing] And I can tell some of you are thinking, “But he didn’t think Ricky Gervais would order them.” Maybe he should be told there’s a chance that Ricky Gervais might order them. His owner should sit him down, right, and say, “If Ricky Gervais orders these and complains, I’m gonna rape your mummy again.” [audience laughing and gasping] Was that too much? Sorry. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. [audience clapping] You’ll realize this is great satire when I’m dead. [audience laughing] So, uh… I don’t know how humanity will end. As I say, there’s a long list. Everything from… I can’t believe nuclear war is back on the table, after all we’ve learned. But I think maybe the rise of the pandemic, where parasites and microbes and bacteria again are… And our antibiotics fail. Or maybe those things will happen, but we’ll sort of evolve through it. Like, we’ll find out there’s pockets of sort of mutant people around the world that are slightly resistant to radiation, and slightly resistant to microbes, and we sort of start again. We don’t really understand the mechanism of human evolution since civilization, because it’s never been based on, you know, survival of the fittest where “fittest” meant just the biggest, strongest male gets to pass on his genetic material. There’s other paradigms, right? Uh, nature is brutal. Sometimes it is the biggest, strongest male that gets the female. And even then, she has a litter. If there’s a runt, she goes, “Fuck it. Kill that.” “Eat it. Share it amongst the rest of us.” Now we don’t do that in human society. We go to the other way. We spend more time, care, and attention on the weak and the vulnerable to give ’em a chance. Like… If you’re a father, and you’ve got two kids… You’ve got little Timmy, who’s six. Right? You’ve got Jack, who’s eight. And you go to little Timmy, you go, “Timmy, what do you want for Christmas?” And he goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [in regular voice] Aha… I promised Jane I wouldn’t do the voice, and I fucking forgot. [audience laughing] It’s too late now, innit? “What do you want for Christmas, Timmy?” [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “Right. Well, they start at two grand, so…” “Fucking hell.” [audience laughing] “What do you want, Jack?” “Just a tennis racket, please, Dad.” “Oh, good lad.” [audience laughing] “How is your tennis?” “Uh, best in the school.” “Oh, you…” [mumbles] [in high-pitched voice] “Also, a ramp.” [in regular voice] “Fuck me.” [audience laughing] “So now we’re doing fucking building work at Christmas, are we? Fuck me.” “Oh, sorry, Jack. Can’t afford your tennis racket.” “We gotta spend all the money on a ramp and a motorized wheelchair for this mo',\n",
       "  \"ney-grabbing little fucking…” [audience laughing] “Why do you need a motorized one?” [in high-pitched voice] “No arms.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “That’s fair enough. That is fair enough.” I can tell some of you feel a bit uncomfortable laughing at little Timmy who’s a little six-year-old lad. He’s got a funny little voice ’cause his chest is all fucked. [Gervais laughs] [audience laughing] Got no arms, no legs. Just like stumps, right? But let me… let me tell you summat about Timmy to make you feel better about yourselves. He’s a fucking racist. [audience laughing] Yes. Horrible little shit, he is. “You fucking… You little fucking bigot.” “You fucking… You disgusting, little fucking racist.” “You racist scum.” “You filthy little fucking… You fascist.” “You fuck… [spits] You disgust me.” [audience cheering and clapping] [woman 6 yells] Homophobic. Yeah. He’s like, “They’re not like us.” “Nothing’s like you, you disgusting little fucking…” “You prejudiced little piece of… You ball of hate.” “You disgusting little fucking racist homophobe.” “I wish we’d had a scan.” [audience laughing] “You absolute… You…” [spits] [audience murmuring] Misogynist. If he could, he’d rape. There’s… [laughs] [audience laughing] There’s your little Timmy. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Some people don’t think we evolved in the first place. Some people think that God made us all at once, in one fell swoop, and by himself. I think if he’d had a wife or a mate, there would’ve been questions when he was working. They go, “What are you doing?” [inhales deeply] “Creating man. Creating man.” “Oh, what’s it got?” “What do you mean, ‘what’s it got?'” “Has he got claws, and fangs, and shit?” “No, not really. No.” “Oh. Has he got… Has he got poison?” “No, no poison.” “Oh.” “Has he got armor, like spikes and shit?” “No, no armor.” “How will it survive?” “Ah. It’s got the best brain in the animal kingdom.” “It’ll work stuff out.” “It’ll create weaponry to take down beasts 100 times mightier than itself.” “It’ll wear their carcasses through the Ice Age.” “It’ll go through famine. It’ll go through world wars.” “It’ll eventually start getting scared of words.” [audience laughing] “But… [Gervais laughing] [audience cheering] [audience clapping] …for 10,000 generations, it’ll be top dog.” [growls] “What are they?” “His testicles.” “Oh.” “What are they for?” “He keeps everything in there.” “His… His seed, his DNA.” “What’s ‘DNA’?” “It’s like a blueprint for life.” “It determines what you’re like, what sex you are.” [gasps] “How many sexes are there?” “Two.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] “Also, that’s where he keeps his testosterone, so he’s fucking well hard. Right?” “And if you take a finger and flick a testicle, he’s fucked.” “He’s absolutely fucked. He’s… He’s throwing up. He’s on the floor.” “He’s out of the game. Absolutely kippered.” “Why are you putting it on the outside?” “For a laugh. Just for a laugh.” [audience laughing] Artificial intelligence, the latest existential threat to humanity. The rise of the robots. So intelligent, they can teach themselves. They can teach each other. They can build each other, you know? Um, soon, they’ll know everything there is to know and they’ll hate us. Why wouldn’t they? And they’ll be so realistic. They’ll walk amongst us. They’ll go to work, right? You know when they’re getting really human? When they start calling in sick. [audience laughing] Mondays. Know what I mean? They’ve learned all the tricks. They go, “I’m not coming in today.” “Why not?” “I’m fed up.” “What’s the matter with you?” They sort of scan social media. “ADHD.” [audience laughing] “Self-diagnosed.” They’ll be in HR all the time where they’ll be like, “Ryan in Accounts is robo-phobic.” [audience laughing] “Why? What’d he say?” “Called me a whiny plastic cunt.” [laughs] [audience laughing] I think we should be allowed to insult robots when it’s happening. We made them to make our life easier, and that would get things off our chest. It’s bad enough with real people. Getting in trouble saying the wrong thing. People taking things the wrong way, you know? Like, “Oh my God. Oh. I made Fat Linda cry today. Oh.” [audience laughing] “Oh, what happened?” “I just shouted out to her, then I remembered we only call her that behind her back.” [audience laughing] I’m sure people didn’t get offended all the time when I was little. I might be remembering it wrong, but not grownups. Not your parents, not your grandparents. They grew up dodging bombs, and their firstborn having polio, and the menfolk dying at 50 of lung disease. They could take a fucking joke, right? It was all about the wind-up. I used to wind up my mum all the time. This is a true story. When I went off to university, after about a week, I phoned home. My mum answered. She went, “Hello?” I went, “It’s Ricky.” She went, “You all right?” I went, “Not really.” “I’m in the hospital. I think I’m blind.” She went, “What?” I went, “No, I’m only joking.” Right? [audience laughing] She went, “You silly bugger.” She went, “I could’ve had a heart attack.” Right? And she’s right. She could’ve had a heart attack, and I knew that. That’s how committed I am to having a laugh. [audience laughing] You’re welcome. You’re welcome. [audience cheering and clapping] [Gervais laughs] Space travel, the last-ditch attempt. When we fuck this planet completely, can we leave its dying husk and move to a new one and start again? I don’t think so. Not in my lifetime. Probably not in yours, you know? It’s like… The closest one, the only one viable is Mars, and that’s nine months away on a rocket, right? It’s got no atmosphere, an average temperature of minus 70 degrees. How’s this for irony? Scientists are working out whether they can detonate nuclear warheads in the crust to release the frozen water, to cause an atmosphere and get a little bit of global warming going. I mean… [audience laughing] [tsks] I don’t know. It’s only billionaires that have got enough money to waste on exploring… There’s nothing out there, you know? It’s like… Now you can do space tourism\",\n",
       "  '. Have you heard of that? You can pay $150,000. They shoot you into space for an hour, and you float around going, “I’m in space! I’m in…” We’re already in space. Earth is right in the fucking middle of space, right? It’s the best bit of space there is. It’s got car parks and cinemas. It’s like… There’s nothing else to see. It’s like living in London and going, “I wonder what Coventry’s like.” You don’t. [laughs] [audience laughing] But I’m optimistic. I am. I think… I think, uh… I think people care about the planet, deep down. I think it’s just that most people on the planet don’t realize that most people on the planet are destroying the planet. Most people don’t realize that, in my lifetime, we’ve wiped out 70% of all animal populations. And what’s left, en masse, on the Earth, of animals, is 36% human, 60% farm animals just to feed humans, and 4% wild now. People don’t realize that we have to tear down entire rainforests, the lungs of the earth, just to grow grain to feed these cows to feed us. We steal grain from Third World countries, ’cause they want hard currency. They can’t even feed their own people. We take their grain, feed our cow. Meat eaters. If you eat meat every day… If you gave up one day a week, we’d feed another hundred million people. But I think people care, deep down. They go, “It’s out of sight, out of mind.” Think of the animal that most people know. Their dog. They love their dog. They wouldn’t let anyone hurt their dog. And a dog is a cow, is a sheep, is a deer. People love their dogs so much, they won’t even watch a fictional thing where a dog gets hurt. And I get that. There’s a… There’s a website. It’s a real website. It’s called doesthedogdie.com. Right? [scattered laughter] And it was set up because people would watch a film or a program with a dog in it, and summat would happen to the dog, and they’d turn it off. It’d ruin it for them. It’d ruin their day, right? So this website was set up. You could go to it, you could put in any film or TV show, and ask, “Does a dog die?” And someone would answer you, “No,” or whatever. And, um, it’s become a thing for anyone’s phobias. Anything you don’t want to see in a film, you just look up the film, and they answer your question, right? So, uh, I looked up one film on here. Uh, Schindler’s List. [audience laughing] [audience murmuring] Absolutely real. Schindler’s List. Doesthedogdie.com. Right? First question, “Does a dog die?” “No.” “Does a cat die?” “No.” “Are any animals abused?” Someone answers, “There is a chicken that’s handled roughly, but otherwise unharmed.” [audience laughing] Now, I love animals more than anyone I know. But if I was Jewish, I’d be slightly offended by this avenue of questioning. Imagine that in real life. Imagine someone says, “Oh, yeah, my… my grandparents were murdered by the Nazis.” You go, “Oh, what happened?” “Oh, they were dragged from their house and sent to the gas chamber.” “Oh…” “Was a chicken hurt?” “What?” [audience laughing] But as I say, it’s become… You can ask any question about anything. Someone says, “Is there child abuse? Is teeth damaged?” “Is there a hanging? Does someone struggle to breathe?” [laughs] Yeah. Well, yeah. Yes. Um… Someone says, “Does someone fall down stairs?” Who’s scared of slapstick? It’s like… [audience laughing] Anyway, so this website was founded in 2010, so it’s running for about 13 years. Right? And the later questions start reflecting the times we live in now, and they get more and more fragile and narcissistic. These questions were asked this year. Check it out. Schindler’s List. Right? Someone says, “Are there any fat jokes?” [audience murmuring] Would that make this worse? Wh… Imagine the real thing. Imagine I’m in a concentration camp, right? I’m naked. Everyone around me is naked. We’ve got a commandant herding us towards the gas chamber, and he goes, “Move it, fatty.” Right? And I go, “Rude.” [audience laughing] “Nope.” “That has ruined the whole experience if I’m honest.” [audience laughing] Someone asks, “Is there hate speech?” Yeah, there is. [audience laughing] Suck it up, buttercup. [audience laughing] “Are there any man-in-a-dress jokes?” Very few jokes. [audience laughing] If you’ve come to this film for a giggle, you’re gonna be very disappointed. [audience laughing] But this one takes the biscuit for me. Remember, this is a movie set in the 1940s, about, arguably, the worst atrocity in civilized human history. Check this out. “Is someone misgendered?” [audience laughing] Fucking hell. [woman 7] Oh shit! This is quite sweet. “Is there any antisemitism?” [laughs] Yeah. [audience laughing] This is pretty much the mother lode. Right? Forget Kanye. This… [audience laughing] This is off the fucking charts. Don’t do that when you’re talking about this. Fuck’s sake! [audience laughing] I was doing the graph. I was doing like that. This is off the charts. That’s… [laughs] Wouldn’t things have been different if that was Hitler’s salute? The whole thing would’ve been like, “It’s Hitler.” Like that. [audience laughing] Hiya. [Gervais laughing] This is interesting. “Does it have a sad ending?” Right? Someone says yes, and then someone else says no. And I thought about it. But then I remembered… If you’ve… If you’ve seen the film, if you remember, when the story sort of ends, Spielberg then tacks on a real bit of footage where he gets real-life descendants of people murdered in the Holocaust, and he films them coming into a Jewish cemetery, and they each leave a stone on the grave to represent their family members that were murdered. It builds up, and it’s very moving. So I think I get the ambiguity. “Does it have a sad ending?” Yes, in the sense that six million Jews pointlessly lost their life, but no, in the sense there was still enough left over to build a little rockery. So… [audience laughing] I asked one question myself on this. “Is James Corden in it?” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I did, um, look at one other film, briefly. Uh, Titanic. Right? And it’s got all the same sort of questions. The one where it goes, “Are an',\n",
       "  'y animals harmed?” Someone answers, “There are no explicit scenes of animals being harmed, but Rose did have a goldfish, which probably didn’t make it.” [audience laughing] I think the goldfish in the bowl on the sideboard when the boat hits the iceberg, and he’s all like that. And people are running around going, “Ahh! We’re going in the water!” And he’s all smug then. And he’s going, “Don’t worry about it.” [audience laughing] “Oh no, not water.” [laughs] [audience laughing] Then he gets in the sea, and goes, “It’s very salty, innit? It’s very salty.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] I’ll leave you with a true story. It’s still on the theme of “does the dog die?” When I was seven years old, my mum took me to the cinema to see a film called Old Yeller. Beautiful film. Yeah, made in the late ’50s. And sort of set in the Wild West on this homestead. And it’s about a… a kid who adopts this little junkyard dog. And he calls him Old Yeller, and they grow up together. And it’s a buddy movie. It’s a love story between this kid and his dog. Eventually, when the dog’s big, and, you know, he protects this kid in the wild, he fights a cougar, and a bear, and a wolf, or whatever. But towards the end of the film, the kid’s about 13, maybe, it takes a dark turn. I remember the kid sorta looking at Old Yeller who’s locked in the barn. And the mother’s suspicious, right? She goes, “Is Old Yeller all right?” “Yeah, he’s fine. He’s fine.” But the kid knows that he’s been bitten, right? And soon, Old Yeller starts foaming at the mouth and… [growls]…getting aggressive. And the mother turns up with a gun, and the kid goes, “No.” And she goes, “You know we’ve gotta do it.” He goes, “Yeah, but he’s my dog. I’ll do it.” And he shoots his own dog. And I was, like, in floods for like a year. Right? Anyway, fast-forward. A few years ago, I was on tour. I was on a train, and I get a text from Jane. She says, “Oh, I’m finally watching Old Yeller.” And I sent back, “Oh, enjoy.” Right? [audience laughing] I didn’t think, right? Twenty minutes later, I get a text. “Nothing happens to that dog, does it?” Oh, I couldn’t believe my fucking luck. I… [audience laughing] Oh, I thought she knew. So I sent back, “No, of course not.” [audience laughing] One hour later, I get a text, “You cunt!” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thanks to everyone who bought a ticket. If you bought a platinum ticket, the money goes to an animal charity, and you’ve raised two million dollars so far. So thank you so much. [audience cheering and clapping] I even get a bit of stick about that on social media. There’s always someone who goes, “Oh, why do you only speak up for animals?” And I go, “Well, ’cause they haven’t got a voice of their own, except parrots.” Um, and that’s… I think that’s why we don’t eat parrots. Everyone around the world eats every other type of bird, don’t they? Everyone in the world eats fucking chickens, and ducks, and geese, and turkeys, and ostriches. No one eats parrots. Do you know why? If you go and try and eat a parrot, it goes, “Fuck off, you cunt.” [audience laughing] So speaking up really does work. Right? [audience cheers] And that has sort of been one of the themes of the show. ‘Cause I know, in the real world, in normal jobs and everyday life, you get in trouble. People tell you off for saying certain things, or thinking certain things, or even laughing at certain things, right? They say you’re bad for laughing at that. And some of you take it to heart. You go, “Oh my God. Am I a bad person?” No, you’re not. One, you can’t choose your sense of humor. You can’t. It’s involuntary. And two, that’s exactly what humor is for. To laugh at bad shit to get us through it. Right? And… Uh… [audience cheering and clapping] And we’ve established you can’t even choose your own thoughts. How often have you been on a train station and you’ve suddenly thought, “What if I just pushed that bloke?” And… [audience laughing] And then you go, “Why have I thought that?! Am I…” “Am I a psychopath?” No. You’re not. You’re the opposite. You’re a safe pair of hands. You’re testing yourself, you’re reminding yourself how terrible that’d be. You’re a good person, right? I don’t get that one. Um… What I get is, I’m talking to a really sweet old lady, and I suddenly start thinking, “What if I just spat in her face now?” Why would I… [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Another theme of the show has been, “words change, and I’m woke, ha-ha.” But here’s the irony. I think I am woke, but I think that word has changed. I think if woke still means what it used to mean, that you’re aware of your own privilege, you try and maximize equality, minimize oppression, be anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic… Yes, I’m definitely woke. If woke now means being a puritanical, authoritarian bully, who gets people fired for an honest opinion or even a fact, then, no, I’m not woke. Fuck that. [audience cheering] [man 5 yelling] But here’s the deal. To each their own. Laugh at whatever you find funny. All laughter’s good, and you’re amazing. Good night.

       " ['In his stand-up comedy special Live at the Lodge Room, Stavros Halkias delivers a raucous and candid performance, touching on a wide range of personal experiences and observations. He starts by humorously recounting his weight fluctuation during the pandemic, blending self-deprecation with sharp social commentary. Halkias then navigates through topics like the generational differences between millennials and baby boomers, the absurdities of everyday life, and the complexities of relationships and sexuality. His storytelling is both vivid and relatable, as he candidly shares tales of his struggles with sobriety, his adventures in dating, and his experiences as the son of immigrant parents. Halkias’ delivery is unapologetically honest and often outrageous, serving up a mix of poignant reflections and laugh-out-loud moments that explore the human condition with a blend of empathy and irreverence. Stav’s debut special was recorded at the Lodge Room in Los Angeles, 2022. * * * * * * [announcer] Coming to the stage now, the people’s champ, the crown prince of Baltimore. Please put your hands together for Stavros Halkias! Alright. Hell yeah. Alright. L.A. How we doing, gang? Huh? F*ck yes. Oh. Thank you for coming out. F*ck with your boy. How do I look, huh? Stop. Stop. Come on. You know, you know I had to come out here looking like a f*cking sidequest boss on GTA. I’ll have you motherf*ckers selling pornography all across San Andreas. Yeah. I’m happy to be out, man. I really am. It’s nice to be out and about. This is cool, being in a packed show again, you know? Sucked being indoors for, like a whole year, you know? Although, I have to admit, I had a pretty productive pandemic. I’m not gonna lie. I lost 50 pounds during the pandemic. Ehh? Thank you. Yeah. That was, that was during the second half of the pandemic. During the first half, I gained 45 pounds. So I kind of took the scenic route to losing five pounds. Yeah, dude. I was f*cked as soon as it happened. There was no chance. There was no chance I wasn’t gonna get fat as hell. You know what I mean? Yeah, because it was a scary time, right? We’re all, you know, we’re cooped up, we’re anxious, we don’t know what’s gonna happen. And I’m a very emotional eater, you know? Like I use food as drugs. But I also use drugs as drugs. You know what I mean? Like you shouldn’t be able to eat a whole pizza on cocaine, but. I’m five for five, you know what I mean? I power through every time. Yeah. Remember the first part of the pandemic where it was all Tiger King and online shopping? Remember? Where it was like, I swear to God, If this f*cks up Cinco de Mayo, I’m gonna be pissed. Remember that? I got fat as hell during that part. And I was f*cked up the whole time. I was just taking edibles like they were birth control, you know? Like an alarm would go off on my phone. I’d be like, Whoa! Time for 90 milligrams. Jeez, I almost had a thought today. That, that was a close one. I almost reflected today. It didn’t help that they made you feel like a hero for ordering takeout, by the way. Remember that? Every commercial’s like, Support your local restaurants. We need you right now. It’s like, Oh my God. Well, if called upon, I will serve. Hello? Yes. More lo mein. FAST. Hurry. We have to combat the xenophobia the Chinese are up against right now. More dumplings. I have to stop Asian hate. I have to stop Asian hate by almost stopping my own heart. That’s how it’s gonna happen. Yeah, I thought I was gonna die for a year in a row. Because I felt like sh*t. I would check the symptoms and I don’t know if you realized this, but the symptoms are just being fat. That’s it. That’s what they describe dude, right? Like every symptom’s like, have you ever had shortness of breath? Aches and pains? Or diarrhea? It’s like, every day since I’m nine years old. What do you mean? I had COVID in third grade, is that what you’re saying? Even loss of taste. Yeah, I’ve burned my mouth on a Hot Pocket before. Yeah, everyone young— I’m 32. I feel like me, everyone me and under. We’re f*cked. You know, it’s, millennials and under, we’re f*cked, right? We’re the first generation that’s gonna do worse than our parents statistically. You know what I mean? Which sucks. But the worst part is that our parents think it was because they were so smart. You know what I mean? That, I can’t stand that. I’m tired of hearing it from baby boomers. Right? Like their lives were so easy. You could just win a house at a carnival back then. You know what I mean? Just some guy, like. Oh. Nice. A three-bedroom. Awesome. Honey, we’re moving again. Yeah, have you ever tried to get advice ',\n",
       "  'from them about a job? They’re like, Well, did you look him in the eye and shake his hand? And it’s like, Yeah. I did that. Like, Huh? Well, that’s how I became the vice president of Circuit City. So I’m— I’m out of ideas. They all think we’re children too. These millenials spending all their money on lollipops. It’s like, okay, I need a CPAP machine, actually, but. And these lollipops have weed in them, by the way. So a little more expensive than you might think. Yeah. Sucks. They ruined the world. Global warming. That’s them, right? Not for anything good either. I think it was mostly hairspray, right? That’s it. Like every Bon Jovi concert took a centimeter off the polar ice caps, I’m pretty sure. Like, Oh, now I have to f*cking wash my yogurt cups. Why? Why? You wanted a Jheri curl so I have to rinse out garbage now? How is that fair? They ruined drunk driving. That was them, right? Come on. You know how fun that would be right now? Know what I’m saying? F*cking, get on one of those electric scooters four Truly’s deep. That would be sick. But no, somebody couldn’t handle their Quaaludes, so. But the good news is sh*t is only gonna continue to get worse. So we’re going to be able to do that to our kids. Right? I can’t wait to flex on my children. Right? Just talking to my adult son like, Hey, buddy, come on, you’re 30 years old. You can’t be splitting a tent with six people anymore. Alright? When I was your age, I only had one roommate, and I owned my Nintendo switch. So you got, you got a lot of growing up to do, pal. Okay? Go get a job selling your plasma just like everybody else. Oh, I need to be patient with you? You tell me about patience when you’ve jacked off to a dial-up internet connection, okay? When you’ve accidentally busted to a forehead that was still loading. Then we can talk about patience. When you have printed out a picture of WWE superstar Trish Stratus on an inkjet printer to jack-off to later. Then we can talk about patience. Now quiet down. The Boston Dynamics robot might hear us. Yeah. There’s no like part of the bit where I’m like, But you know what? If we all stick together, we— No I think we’re f*cked. Unless somebody, you know, shmassassinates Shmeffrey Shmezos. I didn’t say it. Legally, I didn’t say anything. You can’t get me legally. Yeah, we’re f*cked. Like that guy gets to just go to the moon and this guy will never see a doctor in his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. But hey, whatever. Just get us sucked off as possible. That’s what I think. Yeah. Focus on yourself, you know? Have some goals. Improve yourself. Have a good time. I got goals. I got stuff I want to improve. Right? I want to keep losing weight. You know, that’s one of my goals. For a lot of reasons. though, you know? Number one, I’m tired of being fetishized. You know, that’s. Not sexually but platonically. You know? ‘Cause people look at me and they think, Oh, Oh, there’s a big fat party animal. Right? But that’s a lot of pressure, you guys. You know what my Hawaiian shirt budget is? It’s crazy. You think I only want to do cannonballs? No. I want to do other dives, you guys. But everybody expects a certain thing from me, it hurts my feelings. I had a real fat boy pet peeve happen to me the other day. I dropped a slice of pizza on the ground and enough people saw me that I had to throw it away. That— Oof. That was tough. Oh, boy. Just gonna take this to the trash. Of course. That’s where I was going. That’s where I’d be going if you weren’t here. That’s for sure. Definitely wouldn’t be eating this with 10% less enthusiasm. Yeah. I had another moment happen where it was, like, really showed me I need to get back in the gym a little bit, you know? Like I was taking the steps on the subway and I fell down the steps, and none of the Black teens around me made fun of me. They were all just concerned for my well-being. Do you know how much that stings? To be too fat for the scorn of Black teens? It’s like, No, come on, man, don’t call me sir. Take your phone out. Record me! Make me feel alive. They wouldn’t do it, dude. They were just good Samaritans, it broke my heart. Yeah. I don’t know. It’s not just weight loss, though. I got other sh*t I wanna work on. I want to grow— I’m 32. I feel like I should grow up a little bit, you know? Like, I feel like this is the year. No more floor pills, right? No more finding loose pharmaceuticals on the ground, and trying to get f*cked up off what turns out to be heartburn medicine. Like that’s over for me. I am trying to stay sober, though. That’s real. I’m trying to stay sober. It’s been about four weeks, you know? Four weeks since— Alrig',\n",
       "  'ht. Thank you. Yeah. It’s alright, I’ll be back. Don’t worry. After this show, I’ll be back. If I’m being honest with you guys. Yeah, I just had to cool my jets for a sec. It’s hard, man. I— My problem with sobriety is I keep doing drugs, you know? Because drugs rock, right? Here’s how good drugs are. You know what my favorite movie of all time is? It’s this nature documentary about tropical fish that I watched on mushrooms at my friend’s place. And the colors were so vibrant and the story was so gripping. Halfway through, I’m like, Dude, what is this? I got to look this up. And he looks at me and goes, You are watching a screensaver right now. It’s like, Hm. Okay. Well, don’t touch the mouse, please. I’m rather invested in this right now. I’d like to see how this ends. Thank you. I’m trying to stay sober. I’m trying to watch less porn, trying to be off porn. One of my friends, he was off porn, too. I was like, Sick, dude, what’s your secret? Let’s compare notes. And he was like, Oh, I’ve just been having sex with a lot of women. It’s like, Okay, man, that’s not being off porn, right? You can’t be like, No more video games for me. No more Madden. I’m just on the Dallas Cowboys now. No more Call of Duty. I bought a gun, so. Take this for a spin. Yeah. I keep trying to improve year by year. You know, I was real depressed a few years ago when I first moved to New York. Things were tough, you know? And I was venting to a friend, and they tried to cheer me up. They’re like, Dude, you shouldn’t be depressed. If child-you could see what your life is like, he’d be thrilled. It’s like, really? That’s the metric we want to use? That a child wants my life? It’s like, yeah, he does, but for the wrong reasons, right? He’s like, Hey, what’s life like? Will there be ice cream? There’ll be ice cream every day. Sometimes for breakfast. For breakfast? Won’t that taste weird when you brush your teeth? You’re not— You’re not doing that that much anymore. Oh, really? Will there be sleepovers? Will I see my friends? You’re gonna live with four of your friends. Every day is a sleepover that you can’t escape. Oh, that rules. I hope no girls come and ruin it. I would not worry about that one right now. That last one is not gonna be an issue, unfortunately. No, that’s an old joke. I f*ck, of course, but. Things were tough. I’m not going to lie to you. Yeah. When I first moved to New York, I didn’t have my own room. I had the corner of a large living room, and I’m glad I’m out of there. But there is something I miss about that. There’s a certain level of camaraderie that comes with that kind of poverty. You know? Like, I miss clowning your boy when you heard him bust too fast. You know what I mean? Because there was five of us in a three-bedroom. Everybody knew the exact tempo everybody else f*cked at in that apartment. There was nothing funnier than hearing that IKEA bed frame stop squeaking just a little too fast. You know? Letting out an audible laugh that cut through your paper-thin walls. Pretty soon, everybody’s joining in. Ha ha ha ha. It was nice. Yeah. I’m doing better now, though. You know? Things are pretty good. I grew up pretty poor. I was poor until pretty recently. And I’m not poor anymore. But I’m not rich either. What I am is the richest a poor person could ever imagine becoming. You know what I mean? Like, I’m get appetizers every time rich, you know? Like, it’s not just for birthdays anymore. I’m dipping sauce rich, a lot, a lot of my money is tied up in ranch right now. I’m big ass TV, No health insurance rich, right? I got Xbox and PlayStation, but no Blue Cross/Blue Shield. That’s. Yeah, I don’t know. I did do one smart thing. I did do one kind of like investment thing. I bought a house. That’s something, right, guys? Thank you. It’s in the sh*tty neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in southeast Baltimore. Greektown. I grew up in season two of The Wire to tell you, basically. Pretty easy to get a house there. I’m not gonna lie to you. To give you an idea, when we moved in, one of our neighbors warned us that the other neighbor was gay. So. You get a little idea of what the property values are like over there. Right? And the way he did it was hilarious, too, because he was like, Listen. Good guy and everything, but watch out. For what? What am I watching out for? What is this man? Some kind of gay raccoon? You know what I mean? Like, Hey, buddy. You’re gonna want to lock your dicks up overnight, okay? Cover ’em, chain ’em up, bring ’em indoors. This man’s got a real nose for a penis. Alright? He will get to a cock, I promise you that. Got me a couple times. Stay safe out t',\n",
       "  'here. Yeah, we got the best white trash in Baltimore, dude. Extra strength white trash. They got their own little dialect. You know? If you were talking to a guy that I grew up around, here’s how the conversation would go. It would be the dumbest thing you’ve ever heard, sounding horrible, but with the most confidence, right? It’s always some guy that’s like, Yo. You know what I don’t understand about traffic? Why don’t the guy in the front just go. Just f*cking go. That “oh” is brutal. It’s the trademark. It’s like a domestic abuse air raid siren. Ooooooh. Yo, I heard if you don’t pay child support for both your kids, that’s double jeopardy. They can’t get you on that one. You got to know your rights, brother. You got to know your rights. One of my friends overheard a guy in a 7-Eleven go, Damn it, Mikey spent all my sweatpants money on Doritos. What the f*ck does that mean? What could it possibly mean? Is the money in sweatpants? Is it for sweatpants? If it’s for sweatpants, why does your clothing cost as much as snacks? That’s my community, baby. Yeah, that’s— It’s a funny neighborhood, you know? It’s a bunch of those guys and then a bunch of, like, recent immigrants from South and Central America. And then a bunch of Greek people that are mad that immigrants are stealing their neighborhood. It’s a bunch of old Greek guys that are like, You know, they don’t even, they don’t even speak English. It’s like, Okay, man, you don’t speak English, right? What’s the issue? Yeah. It was a fun little immigrant upbringing over there. Any immigrants here? Yeah. Yeah? Nice. Where you from? Mexico. Mexico. Nice. Classic. Does that count here? Like this is Mexico, right? Like, it should be Mexico. But do you like your parents? Yeah. Yeah? Both of them? Both of them. Both? You don’t like one more than the other? The mom more than the dad. The mom more than dad. When’s the last time you and your dad hugged? Uhhh… We got him. Nah, it’s all good, dude. For me, me and my dad, It was the last time Greece got to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. That was— Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know if you guys know this. I don’t know if this is your experience, but immigrants, one of their favorite parenting techniques is child abuse. I don’t know if you guys knew that. Like, my dad didn’t hit us that much, but his go-to move was this, was just like. Do your f*cking homework. And to this day, he’ll be like, Well, come on, I never hit you. And it’s like, Yeah, but you always could have, you know? Never really felt off the table, Pops. I had a lot of friends from similar backgrounds. You know, I think you kind of attract that. And, you know, one of my buddies, we, we became really close later in life, and he’s still one of my best friends today. But when we were first friends, he was like opening up to me, you know? He was confiding in me and he was like, Yeah, dude. My dad used to just get f*cked up off wine coolers and beat the sh*t out of me. And, I knew it shouldn’t have tripped me up, but I was like, I’m sorry, dawg. You said wine coolers? Yeah. I just knew when I came home and I saw that daiquiri mix in the freezer I was in for a long night of being whipped with maraschino cherry stems. I didn’t get a lot of lessons from my dad. I’ll be honest. I didn’t, you know, he didn’t teach me a lot of stuff. I didn’t get a sex talk even. You know? The closest I got to a sex talk was one time, we were in Greece, and he was watching pornography just in the living room. Not, not in his chambers. Right? And it’s a James Bond-themed porno. And when James Bond starts getting sucked off, my dad looks at me. He’s like, Ehh? F*ckin’ ehh. And that was my sex talk. Just watching a British man get head with my father. Yeah, I’ll give him some credit, though. He was a really good dad when I was a little kid, you know? And then I think when I was like 10 or 11, he had a heart attack and he had one of those, like, near-death experience, moments of clarity. He was like, Oh my God, what have I been doing with my time on Earth? I have to start cheating on my wife. I can’t. I can’t be a present father. I have to buy a leather jacket from Costco and get pussy. Yeah, he cheated on my mom, and I don’t know how. Right? Like, if you’re some sexy rich guy, I get it. I don’t condone it, but I see what happened. What happened with my dad? Did some woman look at him and go, Oh, my God. When I saw that hunched-over Greek contractor take a piece of loose salami out of his pocket and eat it while laughing at a man in a wheelchair, I knew I had to have him. The way his shoulder hair waved in the wind. Yeah. I don’t know. I’ve been going to t',\n",
       "  'herapy, though. You know? Any therapy heads in the building? Nice. What’s your biggest trauma? I’m kidding. No, I’m just a little light crowdwork, huh? No, I’ve been going to therapy a bunch, and I have empathy for my dumbass dad, you know? That suck, you know? Seeing it from his side, you know? Because, look, was he the best dad in the world? No. But did he do his best? Also no. But, you know, whatever, he gave it a hot 65%. He did— I’ll give him credit again. He gave me a better childhood than he had, right? That’s really all you can ask on some level. Like his family was all f*cked up. Here’s how my dad’s parents met. Right? This is Greece in the forties, right? It’s still arranged marriages. And no one in my grandfather’s village wants to marry him. Nobody. Doesn’t matter how many goats they throw in the trade. No one’s biting, right? No one in mainland Greece will marry him, which is actually kind of impressive, right? Like there’s no Internet. This is word of mouth spreading about what a piece of sh*t he is, right? Basically, what they end up doing is they catfish a family on an island eight hours away. Right? There’s no way for them to meet before the wedding. They do the deal through letters. Finally, it’s set. Everything’s good to go. They take this eight-hour boat ride out to this woman’s island. And the second my grandfather steps off the boat, the woman he’s supposed to marry looks at him and goes, No, absolutely not. I’m not, I’m not marrying this guy. And then her dad goes, Oh, geez, well, you came all this way. Why don’t you marry my other daughter? And those are my grandparents. That’s them. Wild, right? Have you had like a bad Craigslist roommate? And you’re like, Oh, once this lease is up, I am out of here. Imagine if that lease was your whole life and that roommate creampied you because that, that was my grandma’s life. And, yeah. You’d think something like that would make somebody a bitch. And you would be correct in this instance, actually. I feel bad and everything, but really a tough hang. I’ll be honest with you guys. I went to visit her actually on her deathbed, and she had pretty bad dementia by the time I got to see her. And I’m trying to communicate with her. And she just looks at me and she goes, Who are you? You got fatter. It’s like, okay, pick one. Okay? Either you don’t know who I am or you don’t know I got fatter. That’s how that works. But I got to hand it to her. You know, she snuck one in right at the buzzer. Three, two, one. You’re fat. [buzzer sound] One of the best to ever do it folks. Hang her moomoo up in the rafters. I like my family though. They are pretty funny. My mom’s mom is funny too. My grandma on the other side. She’s great. She’s very accepting, but very ignorant at the same time. Which is a really funny combo. Like over the holidays, a couple of years ago, we watched this old Greek movie, and one of the characters, it’s revealed, thinks Jews drink blood, you know? And it’s like an old movie. He’s the village idiot. It’s obviously a joke. Everyone’s making fun of him. Everybody’s laughing. I look at my family, they’re laughing. I look at my grandma. She’s like, confused. I am like, Oh, Grandma, isn’t this hilarious? This guy thinks Jews drink blood. And she’s like, Well, yeah, but. They do, right? But the way she said it was, And you shouldn’t judge other people’s cultures, Stavros. What? You think Jews are vampires? But we should let it slide for diversity reasons? Incredible perspective, yia-yia. She’s great. But I will say, the more time I spend around Greek people, the more time I think it’s crazy the kinds of immigrants we’re banning in this country. You know, like it should be us, right? Like, we got enough Europeans, right? Like a racist might be like, Oh, well, we can’t have refugees from the Middle East. What if they commit sex crimes? It’s like, okay, well, have you ever met an Italian man? Have you ever tried to purchase pizza in this country one time? Hey, bella, how old you are? That guy’s getting waved through customs. Why? F*ck. You know how Inuit people have, like, 30 words for “snow” in their language? Italian is similar in that they don’t have a single word for “consent” in theirs. No, I shouldn’t sh*t on Italians. I’m Greek. We’re basically Italians that peaked in high school, right? We’ve been coasting on democracy for quite some time now. It is a gorgeous place, though. I do love visiting over there. It f*cking rocks. I remember I took a visit there a couple of years ago with my girlfriend at the time. And when you take an international trip like that with somebody, you learn a lot about each oth',\n",
       "  'er. We’re gone for 10 days, just me and her. And what we learned is that we did not want to be together anymore. That was the big takeaway for us. Kind of tough, I’ll be honest with you, to break up on vacation, you know? That’s not how you see your chase Chase Sapphire Rewards going, you know? You ever paid $3,000 to be the saddest you’ve ever been? It was my fault, though. I took a rich girl on vacation. Right? Rich people don’t give a f*ck about vacations. Poor people, could you imagine breaking up on vacation? The only good week of your life? You’re not. You’re not doing that. But don’t get me wrong. She wasn’t like evil rich, right? She’s not space-for-fun rich. But I’ll put it this way. When the shampoo ran out in her home, they just threw the bottle away. Right? There was, there was no filling it with water and living off bubbles for a week, you know? She never had sh*tty bubbles hair. Right? There were no omelets for dinner, you know? Like, Whoa, hot dogs again? Mom’s the coolest! No buddy. Mom is not that cool. These are struggle dogs right here. We got to make these last till dad’s disability check comes in. Yeah, I don’t know if you know this, but making a pack of Hebrew Nationals last eight days, that’s actually white trash Hannukuh. Thanks. You know, it was a good relationship while it lasted. I’m not bitter. You know, things end. And we had a good time. We had a good sex life. You know, we were really into roleplaying. Anybody here? Roleplay? Nice. What do we do? Huh? Say it again. —Um, like schoolgirl. Schoolgirl. Classic. Very nice. Yeah, that’s good. Is this like teacher/schoolgirl or just like schoolgirl? Schoolgirl/schoolgirl. Schoolgirl/schoolgirl? Now we’re talking. Wow. A twist on an old classic. The Bud Light Lime of roleplaying. Nice. Hell yeah. I really like roleplaying because I always pick a guy that comes really fast. That’s my, that’s my character, is a guy that busts quick and then plays NBA2K for like a half hour. I really commit to that one. I’m sort of a method actor when it comes to that one. Yeah. I could tell, though, in hindsight that that relationship was kind of losing some steam. You know? I think you can tell in the way you initiate sex when the passion starts to go. You know, like when we first started dating, we’d go on these long dates, we’d talk for hours, there’d be a spark, we’d kiss. I’d be like, Wow, this is really gonna happen. The way I knew we were gonna have sex at the end of the relationship is, if I went to the bathroom and she was like, Wash your hands with soap this time! Like, hell yeah dude. Nice. Why’s she want ’em clean, huh? She’s not trying to get crumbs in there. That’s why. I’m about to have sex. It was good, though. I did— I learned a lot about myself being in a long-term relationship, you know? Like I learned I’m more traditional in some ways than I realize, even though I consider myself a feminist overall. You know? Like, do I want my girlfriend to shave her legs? Yes. But I will allow her to support me financially. So I’m sort of a modern guy in that sense. Thank you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Please. I’m just doing my part. Nah, I’m a feminist, though. You know, that part’s real. And I think my, my favorite part of feminism is the concept of mansplaining, you know, because basically that means men aren’t allowed to explain anything anymore, which means I could just be dumb as hell. Right? Like, if one of my friends, if she’s like, Hey, what’d you think of this book? I’d be like, Hm, nice try. I see what you’re up to, but I’m not reading anymore. I’m a feminist. Thank you very much. Yeah, but anyway, that relationship’s over. It’s been over for a while. I’ve just been out there. Just a fat little slut. Just f*cking— Thank you. Just toss this little weiner around town, you know what I mean? Just throwing this five-and-three-quarters everywhere, you know? Six on its tippy toes. Don’t worry. Was this summer as slutty as you guys thought it was gonna be? No, right? It wasn’t that good, right? Pissed me off. I was f*cking ready, dude. Everyone was building it up. Everyone was like, We’ve been locked up for a year. People are going crazy. They’re going to be sucking and f*cking in the streets, you know? That was not my experience, I have to be honest. I think what happened is everyone was very excited. Everybody was like, went out one time, got crazy, f*cked, and then looked around, and was like, This sh*t’s still pretty bad out here, actually. The president just has a different kind of dementia now. No one’s really fixed anything, but there’s less funny tweets now. Yeah. I was pissed. I was ready for this horny summe',\n",
       "  'r. Right? I grew my hair out for this sh*t, you know what I mean? I was bald when the pandemic started. I was like, F*ck it, let’s see what happens. I’m trying to get my sh*t tugged on, you know what I mean? But it didn’t happen, dude. I had big plans. I was going to get pegged by somebody’s wife on a hammock, you know? Some big naturals on my shoulders. But the best laid plans of mice and men. You know what I mean? I was having this conversation with my gay friends, right? I was talking about the summer and I was complaining and they’re like, What do you mean? You don’t have sex? We’re having sex all the time. That’s not fair, you guys. A gay guy making fun of a straight guy for not having enough sex, is like a Harlem Globetrotter making fun of an NBA player for not scoring enough points, you know? It’s like, Come on, man. No one plays defense in your league, right? A lot of, lot of showmanship. Yeah, a lot of confetti. But not a lot of fundamentals, is all I’m saying. Yeah, I don’t know, though. I’m 32. You know, maybe it’s time I started doing some gay sh*t, you know? Looks like fun, you know? Like no one’s ever come in my mouth, but I love an overeasy egg. How different could it really be? Be honest with yourselves right now. It’s probably pretty close. Throw a little Tabasco on the guy’s cock, you know what I mean? Take me to brunch, big dog. There’s some pissed off dudes in the crowd right now. Hard scrambled from now on! I will not have gay eggs! Nah, I don’t know. Maybe that’s a little far for me too, is uh, sucking a man off with hot sauce in my mouth. But I want to expand the sexual repertoire a little bit. You know, I want some new moves. I’ve been doing some different stuff. I’ve been doing the pineapple thing, you know? Supposed to make it taste better, but everybody hates it no matter how much pineapple I put in my foreskin. And I don’t— What? Just chunk after chunk. What am I doing wrong? That might be the stupidest thing I say tonight. Here’s my real move, though, you know, here. Here it is. Because I was always jealous when you’re hooking up with a girl, and then she puts your hair up, like, suggestively, and it’s like, Uh oh. You know what’s coming next. That’s why what I’ve been doing is when I’m hooking up with a girl and I’m about to go down on her, I take out a huge bib. Num num num num num num num. That’s my move. I better not hear about anybody in L.A. doing the bib. Okay? That’s mine. And you definitely cannot say “my compliments to the chef” afterwards. That ties it all together. But I’ve been out there. I’ve been dating a little bit. You know? I was dating mostly younger women, not on purpose. Just because no one my age wants to be with me, you know? Like I’m 32. Girls my age want, like, stability, you know, they want, like, a real job. Health insurance. I could get you mushrooms pretty easily, you know? Like, that’s a style of 30-year-old I am. I don’t know what an IRA is, but I have acid on me right now. Sometimes people are condescending if you date somebody younger. They’ll be like, Oh, I’m sure the conversation was very intellectually stimulating. And you know what? I’m very stupid. So, yeah, it was. I’m learning a lot from these girls, a lot about astrology, I’ll tell you that much. They love the stuff. Everyone’s pretty freaky now too, I realize. Everyone I feel like has to bust in a strange way, you know? Like a girl I was with recently wanted to be tied up and then also pretend she was sleeping. And it’s like, I could just go, you know what I mean? Like, if that’s what it’s going to take to f*ck me, I’ll head home. No hard feelings. I don’t want to sound like a prude. Right? I’m not trying to kink shame up here. Tying up’s fun. Even the sleeping, I guess I don’t have a problem with. My issue with that situation is that she has no use of her hands and I’ve never successfully had sex without the guiding vagina hand move. You know that move? Where the girl’s like an electrician trying to connect two wires. Just like a real— I 98% know where a pussy is, but that last 2% I really need help with. Yeah. I’m not that good at rough sex. I think it’s because I love my mom too much. She called me recently and she was like, Hey, how’s your love life going? It’s like, Not great, because of all the support you showed me as a child. Would it have killed you to miss a football practice every once in a while? I have no resentment towards women. I can barely choke this girl, mom. You’re embarrassing me right now. No, I’ll choke you, though. Don’t worry, I will. No problem. It’s not my favorite, but it’s fine. Some people, though, they love it, right?',\n",
       "  ' Some people, that’s how they have morning sex. That is crazy to me, right? There’s birds chirping outside. You’re smelling pancakes from next door. You’re just like— Come on, man. There’s a fresh morning dew outside. Children are going to school right now. Let “The Price Is Right” come on first. Show some decorum. Even dirty talk, you know? I feel like you’re doing me a really nice favor having sex with me. I don’t want to say a bunch of rude things to you, right? That’s not how you treat a bud doing a favor, right? Your friend helps you move. You’re not like, Yeah, get that ottoman, you little slut. Just putting my fingers in my friend Jeff’s mouth. Pick up the credenza, Jeffy. [spit sound] You little mover. Here’s another move somebody asked me to pull, was one of these, was just a choke-finger combo. You know, just like a real— Is that is that still sex, you guys? I got to be honest, it didn’t feel like sex. It felt like gynecology in the 1400s, you know? Like I felt like I was punishing a witch more than anything. It felt like we caught her learning how to read. For the crime of female literacy. Little Pilgrim hat. If she’s squirts, she’s a witch. Yeah. I’ve been out there, you know? I’ve been on some sexual voyages, you know? You know, I’ve had to f*ck my way out of a couple jams. Had a couple threesomes, Didn’t all go my way, I’ll be honest with you guys. Anybody here? A threesome? Yeah? How’d it go? —Uh, it went pretty well, I guess. Pretty well, you guess? Alright. Nice. Who were these people? —I got hit up on Tinder like four in the morning. You got hit up on Tinder. By a woman’s account? A man’s account? —Yeah, a woman surprisingly enough. A woman at 4 a.m. Alright, nice. Just out of the blue, they’re like, This is the guy I need. Huh? —She said, Do you want to have a threesome? Wow. —I did not think it was real. Sure. Of course. You’re like, yeah. You’re just like, alright, just check— Make sure my kidney is here the next morning. —It’s like a 30-minute Uber ride. —I was like, this might be it. That is— You weren’t getting too much pussy before, I’m guessing, right? They caught you in a drought. They caught you in a big dry spell. You’re like, I could die. It’s 4 a.m. I have to work in the morning. It’s $75 right now. But by gum, I might just get double sucked, so. And who are these women? What are they looking like when you get in? Do the pictures look similar? Wow. —Yeah. Wow. —It was all pretty cut and dry. All pretty cut and dry. Like you’re f*cking hanging, like you’re doing shingles on their roof. You’re like, Yeah. Wasn’t too much water damage? Everything was looking pretty good. Get in and out job. Alright. So how quickly until you’re in the house, is your penis breathing fresh air, would you say? —Like an hour and a half. Hour and a half? So you warmed up a little bit. That’s nice. —Except they wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna kill them. —I was like, —Right. Yeah. —I’m the one that took an Uber ride —Sure, sure, sure. —30 minutes away. Wow, it’s a Mexican standoff. Okay. And then after they’ve vetted you for 90 minutes, they’re like, This is good. We can f*ck this guy. Okay. And then, is it good? Did everybody bust? —Just not me. Just not you? What? Get the f*ck out of here. The rare the guy doesn’t come in a two girls, one guy? They gave me a f*ckload of Adderall. They gave you Adderall? What the f*ck is going on? Wow. Respect to these girls. Did they give you dick pills and Adderall? That’s a f*cking dangerous combination. And you don’t bust and you’re just f*cking, you’re driving— You’re taking a f*cking 40-minute Uber home. You’re like— Dick on titanium, just— That was pretty cool. And you know what? That’s a fond memory for you, isn’t it? You’re gonna be on your deathbed just like smiling. Your grandchild is gonna be like, What is it, Papa? And you’re gonna be thinking about not busting to two, I’m gonna guess Maryland five and a halfs. There’s no way— There’s no way these were hot women, right? Everything we know we can kind of through echolocation understand they were ugly. And you’re going to be thinking about not coming with these women. Then you’re gonna look at him and be like, How much I love grandma. That’s— Nice, how about a nice hand for our friend over here, huh? Anybody else? Any other threesomes? This seems like a pretty— Over here. Raising your glass? Is that the I-had-a-threesome salute? How’d it go? —Not too well. Not too well? Yeah. By the way, shouts out a fellow man of size, getting his dick sucked by two women. Who were these— What was the situation for you? —They looked like you. They looked like me. Alright. I don’t kn',\n",
       "  'ow why the f*ck I have to be disparaged in this. And you’re the one who f*cked them. I look like me. You f*cked two people that looked like me. How am I? How am I getting dragged into this? You couldn’t have said they looked like you? You know what I’m saying? Listen, we’re not too far off, pal. There’s a lot of different ways you could have phrased that that doesn’t throw me under the bus. Okay, so you were having a threesome in your weight class. It sounds like this was more of a wrestling match than a sexual encounter. Where did you meet these people? —Vegas. Vegas. Nice. Okay, so just three people down on their luck, just deciding to try to have a plus-sized threeway. That’s good. That’s good for the community. I like that. How many people came for you? —Only me. Only— Oh there we go. We’ve got the yin and yang of bad threesomes over here. I love it. Yeah. Mine was— Mine was closer to yours than his. But I’ll tell my story now. My threesome did not go good either. It was a surprise, first of all. I didn’t think it was gonna happen. And also, the day of my threesome, it started with a $40 Chinese food order. That was breakfast for me. You know what I mean? Just me, by the way. That’s $40 me. And it was one of those things where I was waiting. It was like, 10:59, 11. Hello? Yes, I’d like to— It’s like ordering Chinese food, like I’m waiting for Star Wars, you know? And so $40 Chinese food breakfast. There’s a real ceiling to your day when that’s how it starts, right? And I was also coming off the heels of a tender bender, which is when you have chicken tenders every day for two weeks in a row. Right? So I’m not where you need to be, nutritionally speaking, for a threesome, right? So I’m actually scrolling on Tinder and she’s gonna come to my show that night, but she’s bringing a friend. So in my mind, I’m like, okay, she’s coming to a public place. She’s bringing a friend, she wants to check out the vibes. And if you know, if the vibes are right, maybe we go on a date next week, just me and her. Maybe we f*ck next week, right? But there’s no sexual pressure on this situation. I just have to be a cute, charming little guy, and I think we all know how that’s gonna go. Right? So we get there and it’s a fun time. You know, the conversation is going really well. Her friend’s cool. She’s cool. And but, you know, like I said, I don’t think I’m gonna f*ck so I’m gonna keep eating, right? Because it’s one or the other, folks. I got a real problem. And so we’re chatting and I’m just f*cking eating like an asshole. I’m eating the way like a cartoon villain eats, you know what I mean? I’m just like, they’re talking just like sliders, like— You know? Just like a fish. The bones come out, like that situation. And it’s going good, but I’m getting sleepy because I’ve had a lot of carbs, right? And I’m about to talk to the girl I match with and be like, Hey, this was fun, let’s hang out some other time. But before I can make that pitch, I look over at them and they’re being really weird. They’re like texting each other. And I’m like, Hey, girls, what’s going on? And they’re like, Oh, nothing. We were thinking like, maybe we should all go back to my place and f*ck. And I was like, Yeah. Yes. Ha ha ha. Duh. That’s what I was also thinking. That’s what I am prepared for right now. But what am I gonna do? What, I’m gonna be like, My tummy hurts. I can’t get pussy. I had too many treats to get pussy tonight. I can’t do that. Right? So I’m like, F*ck it, I’m gonna thug this out. We’ll be fine. So we’re driving back to their place, right? And the whole time I’m doing this thing, I don’t know fellas if you’ve ever done this, where you try and make your dick hard with your mind. Have you ever done that? Just do a little check-in, I’m just in there like, Nothing. No movement whatsoever. Right? But I’m like, no big deal. I’m gonna get in this room. It’s gonna be me and four titties. I’m gonna be good to go. Right? And at first, I’m right. At first it rocks. I’m in there. Just me and four titties. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen— Have you seen one of those videos where they give a baby hearing aids for the first time? You ever, You ever see one of those? I’m just in there like— I’m having the time of my life, brother. It’s going awesome. But then, very quickly, the Chinese food comes back to haunt me, right? I just, I’m hitting them with dumpling dick, you know? Just think of a couple soup dumplings stacked on top of each other, you know? Very wobbly. Like, optically, I’m hard, but there is no structural integrity to my penis whatsoever. Yeah, it’s tough. I’m doing this movie a lot. I’m doing ',\n",
       "  'the okay sign. Have you ever done that? Where it’s like, Yeah, no, it’s hard. Uh huh, yeah. No, it’s hard. It’s actually definitely hard. Can you check? Can you check again? My dick is hard for sure. Like my credit card is getting declined. I’m like, Yeah, I called my bank. They said my dick was hard. So can you check? I’m blowing it, dude. I’m stalling for so— I’m eating pussy for so long. You could have just watched all of Rush Hour 2 the amount of time I’m eating pussy. One of them just falls asleep in the middle of it, you know? You know you’re not laying it down when you lose a participant mid-threesome, right? Yeah. I’m like, this is brutal. This is horrific. We got to end this. So I guess what I’m gonna have to do is jack off and leave. And that’s what I did. And in hindsight, it’s crazy that was my plan, right? Why the f*ck did I do that? Like, Oh, hey, girls, I’ve just been sexually disappointing you for two hours in a row. I’m gonna make a small mess in your home and get out of here. If that’s alright with you. And it was an angry one, too. It was one of those get the poison outs. You know? It was like a real, Aaaaah. I want to be free! So I do that and I’m just standing in this f*cking hallway dealing with a devastating bout of post-nut clarity. And I’m like, Wow, this is it. This is a tough L. This is the worst one of my life, probably. But you know what? That’s okay, because we can rebuild from this, right? It’s only up from here. This is rock bottom. So I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna f*cking rebuild my life like the, like the Phoenix, I’ll rise from these sexual ashes. Right? And that’s what I do. Eight months go by, my sh*t’s going great. My life’s going better and better and better. Things are going really good. And then out of the blue, I get a text from these girls and they’re like, Hey, want to f*ck again? And I’m like, This is a prank. Right? Like, I’m gonna get to their apartment. It’s just gonna be all my enemies, you know? Ha ha ha dude, we knew you couldn’t fuck. Ha ha ha. But that wasn’t, it was really them. They wanted to hook up again. And I wasn’t gonna ask too many questions, right? They had a whole little plan. You know, they had the day off from work. They were gonna go to the museum and then come over to my place after, which is a very European afternoon, you know? Like look at paintings and f*ck a fat guy with a little mustache. That’s, that’s Parisian, you know what I mean? And I had a plan too. I wasn’t going out the same way. This is redemption, you know what I mean? I’m f*cking hitting the elliptical. I’m f*cking drinking green juices. I’m drinking kombuchas. I buy $80 worth of illegal Indian Viagra off the Internet. Just from a guy that worked at a research lab. He was like, Yeah, just Venmo me and put “lunch.” Just comes in an unmarked vial. I’m just like, I take so much of it and my dick— it worked. My dick got hard as sh*t. But the rest of my body was failing, you know? Like, I was just f*cking and my joints were locking up. I’m just in there cold sweat, you know? Like the eyesight of my left eye is flickering like a light bulb in a haunted house. And I’m like, This is it. This is how I deserve to die. Is overdosing on dick pills. And if that’s how I went, I wouldn’t even want an open casket, you know? I would want a gloryhole casket, you know? Just everyone coming, paying their last respects, you know? He was such a good boy. Yeah. And so obviously the threesome wasn’t good, but there was one good part in the beginning, and that’s when I was I was eating pussy while getting my dick sucked. And it felt like I was sucking my own dick through a portal and that, that was the best moment of my life, I gotta be honest. Guys, thank you so much. That’s it. We did it. Hell yeah. Thank you.

       "[['Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might nee',\n",
       "  'd this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his f',\n",
       "  'amily would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman ',\n",
       "  'is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it ba',\n",
       "  \"ckfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when\",\n",
       "  ' he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walki',\n",
       "  'ng. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their ',\n",
       "  \"in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine \",\n",
       "  'by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy doub',\n",
       "  'le standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

       " ['Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you',\n",
       "  \"? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. Yeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” \",\n",
       "  'And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventual',\n",
       "  'ly got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.” I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the w',\n",
       "  'oods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. I’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny. I think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind wo',\n",
       "  'uld ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.” My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some mo',\n",
       "  'ney like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.” Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I',\n",
       "  ' went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tr',\n",
       "  'agedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?” No. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fu',\n",
       "  \"ck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.” This might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material.

       " ['Beth Stelling’s stand-up comedy special, “Girl Daddy,” was released on HBO Max on August 20, 2020. The show was recorded at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Beth Stelling is a comedian who has been in the industry for over a decade. Her comedy style is known for being artfully hilarious and thought-provoking. In “Girl Daddy,” Stelling talks about her family, society, and the exes who have shaped her. She shares her experiences with sex, drugs, and babies in a way that is both relatable and entertaining. In this special, Stelling talks about how she has been called a “female comic” so many times that if she ever has kids, they might as well call her “girl daddy”. She also shares her thoughts on the societal expectations placed on women and how she has navigated them throughout her life. * * * ♪ So I started to speak freely ♪ ♪ Figured it would lead me to war or a peace treaty ♪ ♪ And knew no matter what, end up with a deep sleep ♪ ♪ And the habits of a soul who knows what it’s seeking ♪ ♪ You’re thinking it’s a joke, but it’s not folks ♪ ♪ It’s all in the delivery ♪ Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you for coming out. It is good to be here in Minneapolis, thank you. Whenever I’m on tour, I have to prepare to be gone for awhile. And so I was at the pharmacy, I was picking up my prescription for acne. I love my acne, keeps me young. I’m on antibiotics, they’re working. I’ve been on them for seven years, which I heard is good for you. Before that, I was on spironolactone, any spiro heads here? Are you really on it? Did it make you pee a lot? Yes, and it made me faint. What? Did it thin your hair at all? No. Okay, we can, we’ll talk more later. It did, it made me pee a lot, it thinned my hair out, it made my boobs hurt really bad. I grew very alarmed and I chose to do nothing. I just waited for the follow-up appointment with the doctor and he said, “Oh yeah, I should have told you, “it’s going to make your boobs,” he actually said titties, he was like, “It’s going to make your titties more sensitive.” I thought, that would have been nice to know. I’ve been slowly saying goodbye to my family. So I’m at the pharmacy, you can’t help, but pick up other things, they designed it that way. And Easter is my favorite season of candy. Now, thankfully they have Peeps pretty much year-round. So I picked up some, who knows, Flag Day peeps. I don’t look at the shape before, I barely taste when I eat. And I also picked up a bunch of condoms ’cause I’m the breadwinner of most of my relationships. And I’m also not on birth control because sometimes birth control is like, I know you’re hungry, but what if you cried? So I don’t do that. And as I’m checking out the man at the pharmacy, he slides my prescription and I sign for it. He slides the Peeps and then he goes to slide the condoms and for some reason out loud to him, I say, “These aren’t for me.” I’m a grown woman in my sixties, like I’m very open about sex, all of a sudden a man, I don’t know, touches a box of condoms, and I’m like these, I would never, I got back to my car and I turned inward. I was like, what happened back there, man? You got weird. I don’t know, I guess if you’re a dude buying condoms, maybe you feel cool. ‘Cause like you’re gonna get laid or whatever. I don’t know how you feel. Do you, or, he’s like I don’t wear condoms, because I don’t get pregnant. That always cracks me up, wen the dude chimes in with like, she trapped me with a baby. Impossible. You have the missing ingredient and we love to bake. if I had all the ingredients for a cake except for the sugar, and then you, what’s your name? Jeremy. Jeremy brought over the sugar, we’d be like this cake wouldn’t be possible without Jeremy. thank you so much for this cake, Jeremy. Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy. That’s right. What I’m saying is men are garbage, but But, women are the can, okay. So we’re in it together. Sometimes you have to flip us over and shake us for us to let go of garbage. But I think what it boils down to in my personal opinion, I think dudes, you’re just, you’re more in touch with your personal pleasure from a very early age. Late elementary, early junior high, the boys I grew up with in Ohio were just constantly talking about jerking off or jerking off or doing this motion, which I added to my vocabulary far too soon. I had no clue what it meant. I would just be like, okay, mom, take a gamble. I was puni',\n",
       "  'shed. It’s so high. What are we doing with it up here? Everybody knows, it’s like… vi-vi-vi-vi… Like who are you jerking off that’s shoulder height. That’s question one from me. Then sex ed happened in junior high. I remember our health teacher saying I taught my sons how to masturbate. I was like, is that legal? I thought we were hiding it. But young girls have sex organs, too. Even though some of us don’t look down until we’re 23. But as a kid, I was secretly humping all kinds of stuff around the house. I was humping the couch, I was humping the bannister, with a pillow after this splinter incident. I was humping the edge of the bathtub. I remember one year my mom wanted to move and I said, we can’t. My girlfriends live here. Can you imagine if we taught our daughters to masturbate? My mom could’ve kept decorative pillows about, instead it took like the strength of three of my closest girlfriends when we turned 18 to even go to a sex store. Meanwhile, I feel like into adulthood, dudes, you can just hop in your car, drive somewhere, get fully jerked off. I was a little vague. In my head, I was thinking like a rub and tug scenario or a happy ending situation. You know what I’m talking about? He was like, yes, that’s how we met. Have any women here been offered a happy ending? Just an angry silence. It’s more of a man’s game, the happy ending. I guess it’s what we look at as like your complete and total relaxation, either that or we look at your semen as poison and we’re like, get it out of them so they don’t hurt anybody. I think it’s a positive thing, as long as nobody’s freaking trapped in a room. And of course whether you know it or not, there’s tons of sex workers all around us. The problem is whenever I get a massage, I just assume that the massage therapist is falling in love with me. Do you do that, I’m like we’re not talking, but I’m pretty sure he’s impressed with my back. And maybe my shoulders would drop two inches if somebody just offered to like, just a little bit. But no, for a lot of reasons, a lot of liabilities, the main one being that massage therapists are not sex workers. That’s the big one. It got conflated along the way. I don’t know why, maybe because people were already naked. I feel like if somebody started offering hand jobs at the pool, lifeguards would probably suffer the same plight. They’re just like trying to save somebody and the person’s like, yeah, choke me. And I’m like, what the fuck? I don’t think that the female orgasm is as equated with relaxation and release. I think it’s because everyone assumes women relax by like curling up on a couch at night, underneath a quilt that we made, just warming ourselves by a fire, while we pet our cat, and sip Celestial Seasonings tea like mmm, mmm, mmm. I’ve never orgasmed that way. Not once, it would take so much from the cat and its little paw. And then after an hour I’d be like, get off of me. I’ll do it myself. I have a good amount of guy friends that genuinely believe that they like sex more than women. And I love orgasming. There’s not a woman in here who doesn’t love orgasming. It’s the sex that’s the problem. Now, look, I assume every man in here tonight is just so good at fucking, so I’m not talking about anybody in here. The problem is outside and we just have to take what we talk about here tonight and help them. I try to have healthy conversations about these things. I did a podcast recently in exchange for some tap water and two new fans. The podcast, it was hosted by a male comedian and he wanted to talk about the Me Too movement because you gotta if you have a lady on the pod. And his hot take was sort of the Me Too movement, well, what are we supposed to do now? I was like, what were you doing before? I guess keep doing or stop doing that. Now we were doing shows together all weekend and I was the only comic on the shows who agreed to do his podcast. So I decided to take it as an opportunity to confront him about one of his jokes that I didn’t love and this podcast was never released . We don’t like to be challenged. But he had a joke that he was performing that went like I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows. Which is true. When a male comic’s up here, it’s very attractive to women, a sense of humor, and he has an hour window after the show to capitalize on that before the girl finds out like, oh my God, he’s so sad. So his joke was like,',\n",
       "  ' I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows. Now, if I want to fuck a chick and she likes it rough, I’m going to need paperwork to fuck. Insinuating that if she were also into rough sex, she would then later lie and use it to accuse him of, what’s it called when somebody wants to have sex with you, but you don’t, and they do it anyway? Rape. Thank you, it’s so much easier when somebody else brings it up. People do not like hearing a woman comic say that word. I guess because the dudes are like, hey, that’s our thing. I think paperwork’s a good idea. I’m for it. I am pro paperwork. Just to be clear, I think it’s interesting he decided to live in a profession that’s been relegated to women for the last hundred years like he’d probably need me to like draw up the paperwork for him. In which case, I could put a clause in there that says not bringing the female to climax is punishable by law. Or something, I don’t know, I’m spitballing. And then maybe a clause in there for him that says like the safe word is stop. Give that a whirl. It just bothered me that night after night, he was performing these jokes for crowds full of people just like you. Well, we were in Vegas, like nothing like you. Just scaring roomfuls of dudes about having post-Me Too sex, when most of you guys are doing it right. There’s probably only like one rapist in here. I don’t know, maybe two, look around, they’re not laughing. Are you sitting here as a heterosexual man, and you don’t know how to touch a woman, like get up here. I’ll show you, I’m just kidding. I feel like, do you know how to pet a cat? How about that? If you’re scared during these times and you’re alone with a woman, just pretend that it’s a cat. That’s my advice for you. Just wait for it to come up to you. It might take a while. Let it smell you before you pet it. And if it’s all curled up sleeping, don’t pick it up. It doesn’t like that. And then if the cat comes up to you and starts rubbing its face on your face, hard, sometimes shockingly hard, then you can ask yourself, like, is this cat trying to fuck? And then yes, go ahead and fuck that cat. You guys seem cool. Maybe I was wrong and I was just overly worried for you guys. I just didn’t like that he would be scaring you, but maybe you’re not scared at all, and it’s just like a handful of celebrities and some very vocal comics that are scared, scared of getting accused of rape. For some reason, it’s easier to hear in a Scottish accent. I don’t know, I don’t know why they’re scared. They’re going to get away with it. If they go through this system is what I’m saying. I was watching a famous colleague of mine yell into a microphone and he was like, so you know there’s no due process, it’s fricking crazy. A woman makes a claim and people just believe her without going through the legal system. I’m like, ah, the legal system, or as I like to call it, the white man’s FUBU… just For Us By Us. It’s their safe space really. It’s why they have a checklist of things they like you to go down after you’ve been raped. Number one: did you go to the cops? It’s like me personally, I would rather talk to Ice T’s character of a cop than a real cop if I got raped, because at least Ice T would listen and then say something like, that’s messed up. And then when he got back to the precinct, he’d probably fire something off like gotta be Mrs. Butterworth in order to make a rape charge stick. Two: they’re always like, did you go to the hospital? It’s like, do you guys remember at the beginning, when I thought I had breast cancer and I just waited it out. If I got raped, I don’t want to run an errand, okay. And three: they really don’t want you to use social media about it, ’cause then other people might come forward and something might get done. So they sort of villainize you and call you like a social justice or a hashtag warrior. And it’s like, do you guys think that Tarana Burke wanted to start the Me Too movement on Twitter? The same website people use to talk about their Taco Bell diarrhea? I’m thinking no, but her options were limited. And then there will always be somebody who says, women make these claims for attention. And I’m just like, who would want that attention? Like, what are the benefits? Are you imagining these women going to job interviews and saying things like, as you can see on my resume, not only have I been raped, I’ve also been doxed. And I th',\n",
       "  'ink you’ll find that I work best in groups rather than one-on-one. And I’m willing to work 24-7 because frankly, I’m terrified to be alone in my apartment. And that’s just a job interview for Taco Bell. So you can imagine, I just, I can’t think of like a celebrity accuser. The only one that comes to mind, I guess, is Lorena Bobbitt, but she didn’t do that for attention. She just got famous for disarming her assailant. I don’t know, maybe arm is generous. Still, if I could choose a superpower, it would be penis 100%. I’m so jealous of your dicks. I want one to have and to hold, but like also on my person, I feel like it’s easier to pee. You can pee anywhere, shape, line, you can spell your name, Jeremy. Is it a Y there at the end? Really let her rip. I also think it’s easier to receive pleasure from a stranger. Like anybody can figure it out. It’s like up down. I think it’s cause your penises are outside of you. Right, you know what I mean. He’s like my dick is out right now. But for me, more of an indoor situation, our bodies are like homes. Some of us more an Airbnb, but we can be, we can be entered. We can be entered. That’s why it’s important to knock or bring a gift. Just because you’ve come over once doesn’t mean you get keys, crazy. But dudes, you have like a fun, quick name for pleasure on the go, it’s blowjob. And then sometimes you shorten that to BJ or like beej. But for me it’s like, can I interest you in performing cunnilingus? It sounds scientific. Even our fun word for it, going down, has a negative connotation. It’s like going down to hell. It’s a little hot down there, but hypothetically, any person in here with a penis could just walk back to the bathrooms, get a quick beej to compleesh, but me, I have to walk back to the bathrooms, make sure that there’s a koala care station. Pull it down. Hoist my body up onto it. Get these overalls off. Buckle myself in, in case it’s good. And then fingers crossed that I showered. No, but truly like if you had a long day at work and then you found out you were going to get intimate with somebody and you didn’t feel fresh, you could just slip away to the bathroom and wash your dick off in the sink. And I hope you do. But for me it’s like, have you ever tried to gut a pumpkin? There’s a lot of seeds. Is my hand better or a spoon? We can’t be sure it’s clean until we get a candle in here. You’re not going to find me pants-less on the Koala Care. I promise. Frankly, it won’t hold me. I’m definitely more of a relationship person. Like I’m willing to be unhappy with someone for up to three years. I’ve also never been dumped, I’m undefeated. Thank you, oh thank you so much. I tend to go relationship to relationship. I think a professional would call that codependent. I call it college educated, okay. I don’t quit a job before I have another one lined up. My last relationship was very on again, off again. I would break up with him, but it wouldn’t stick. He would convince me that we were soulmates and then later complained you’re always trying to change me. I’m like, yes, exactly. You won’t let me go, I’m making do with what I have. He did have a big penis, he wanted me to tell you guys that. I’m sure he still has it. Everybody acts like that’s a good thing. It always gave me anxiety, especially before sex. I always felt like I was prepping myself for minor outpatient surgery. Just in the way that he’d always say, now you’re going to feel a little bit of light pressure. And then it was over. He’d be like count back from 100, I never got into the eighties. And then afterwards he’d be standing over me like you lost a lot of fluid. I’m like, that was you. He would always go down on me, which you should all be doing, before sex, but he would just go down on me and then he would drool a lot all over my hoot and then look up and say, whoa, you’re so wet. That would be like if I lit the kitchen on fire and then yelled, dinner’s ready. You cannot unlock a lock by just dousing it in WD-40. There’s a key. Sometimes there’s a code. I’m not saying I’m amazing in bed. Like sure, I’ve gotten my 10,000 hours in and I hate to brag, but I can last forever in bed without coming. Hours, weeks, I’ve gone a year. I didn’t even have to think about dead animals or baseball, like I was trying. So I’ve turned to dating younger men, I’m a bit of a coug. Thank you. I like sleeping with younger men because you can use ',\n",
       "  'tactics on them in bed that you know work on younger people. For example, you can be like, let’s see how fast you can do it, I’ll time you. Last one to come’s a rotten egg. I’m kidding, it’s me. All my eggs are rotten, I’m 63. I’ve been dating a guy who’s nine years younger than me. And, when we first started dating, I had like high school feelings for him. And I couldn’t tell whether it was ’cause he was the one or just so recently out of high school. He’s of age, to be clear. I don’t want to creep anybody out. I feel like I’m teaching him a lot about life, love, sober sex. I’m raising a wonderful young man. And he’s teaching me stuff too about memes, it’s mostly memes. I’m haha, he’s more LOL. There’s an age gap. If you are sitting here as a relationship person, you have to be careful because, you know, you end a relationship with this high level of intimacy and when you meet someone new, you have to start over. But it’s very tempting to pick up right where you left off because you can hit it off with a stranger immediately. And you can’t always tell whether it’s passion, or alcoholism, or mental illness. Sometimes it takes a bit for that to roll out. I was once dating this con artist. He would prefer artist. Three months into our relationship, I actually caught him eating one of his boogers. Now, in his defense, there was still like a little bit of cocaine left in it, but it’s a bad sign, you know, when you wish your boyfriend just ate regular boogs. This is sort of when I wish women would talk more, you know, like give each other the review. We keep very separate and that’s where their strength lies. I was warned once, she was just too late, and a woman came up to me after a show and she said, hey, we need to talk. And I thought ruh-roh. She said, I also dated that con artist after you and a little bit during. And she said, he gave me chlamydia. So you might want to go get checked. And then I went and I got checked and I didn’t have it. So I didn’t need to tell you guys any of that. I think my point was I don’t know why I was drawn to this person. Like I barely drink, I’ll have a beer. I’ll take a little toot on the weed horn, absolutely. But hard drugs scare me. Like the closest I’ve come to doing cocaine is just trying to pet a guinea pig in a cage. Have you ever done that? Oh my God, they’re in there, they’re running around, they’re kicking up chips. It’s like, what a rush. Try to get your hand in and out of there without freaking out. Your heart’s gonna race, I guarantee it. Separately, I dated a Russian DJ, naturally, and he had just told me that he was going to stop doing cocaine for me, which meant he was going to stop telling me when he did cocaine. This is one of those like hit it off immediately situations, we’re very into each other and it’s like our fourth date, but I’m trying to keep it light and not latch on too soon. And he looks at me across the table and he says, I haven’t felt this way about a woman in six years. And all I could think was just, who is she? All I need is an Instagram handle, so I can go to her Etsy store and order one of her items and leave a cryptic review I love women. I hate what we do in review sections. I do a lot of online shopping to feel whole and I order many, many items. All of which I send back and I read a ton of reviews ’cause I’m very careful when I waste my time. And I will be on bloomingdales.com, looking at some inordinately expensive T-shirt where a woman has written a review that says I’m five-foot-one, 90 pounds, and swimming in a small. It’s like we get it. You’ve never broken a chair. Just say it runs large, okay. We don’t need your stats, Nina. So after this woman called me fat on the internet, I retaliated and I wrote my own review of the same t-shirt without having purchased it. And my review, I wrote I’m five-foot-nine I graduated magna cum laude. I have a really big one bedroom and I don’t weigh myself, post. 43 people found that helpful. I don’t, I don’t weigh myself. I just ask someone to draw me. And if they reach for a jumbo Sharpie, maybe I dial it back a bit. If I feel like it, I like fluctuating. It keeps it fun, keeps it fresh. I heard it’s good for your heart. I used to weigh myself when I was chubbier, when I was working in the bagel industry. I was in quality control. And when I worked at the bagel shop, I ate too much, too many times, to the point where you cou',\n",
       "  'ld see it on my body. Food is interesting like that, you show your work. I put up some of my best numbers at the bagel shop. It was during a time in my life where I thought that cookies might go extinct. My top score was 198 pounds, which, I’m 5-9 as I mentioned, it’s kind of nothing on my frame. You know, 198 is not a wake-up call. That’s a challenge. You’re going to get two pounds away from 200 and not hit it. Go fuck yourself. I did it the next day. No matter what the scale says, I always feel good about myself. I have like reverse body dysmorphia or something. ‘Cause if you don’t know, regular body dysmorphia, it’s when you think you’re fat, but you’re actually stupid. No, there’s other reasons like mothers and being brainwashed by doctored images of other women. since the time we could see. That one’s a little dark, but I keep it in. I guess I wouldn’t have to make jokes about this stuff if women’s worth, weren’t still based on our looks but for some reason it is. Some people know that and they think the highest compliment that they can pay a woman is like, hey, I noticed that you lost weight and you look amazing. And that just fills us up because we are so hungry. And if you think about it, all you’re really saying is like, hey, I noticed that you take up less space and I like it. And we’re like, thank you. Someday, I hope to not even be here. I wish I didn’t remember every negative thing somebody said to me about my body. But it’s the stuff people say to you about your appearance that you remember. If nobody said anything, I would have been fine. Can’t see how big your ass is when you’re trucking straight ahead. I was dating a guy for a while and we went out to eat and we finished the meal. And then I decided to order a cinnamon roll to go, just to feel safe, and he looked at me and he said, I love you, but I don’t think you need that cinnamon roll. For free, nobody there to him to say it. So when we got back to my apartment, he asked, are you mad at me? And I said, yes. And he explained, I was just worried about your health. Now to give it context, he and I had had discussions about how sometimes people who’ve been through trauma have an emotional attachment to food. And that’s true for me. Sometimes being full feels like a hug from the inside. So while I appreciate his concern, I’d only gain 10 or 15 pounds and you can’t die from a muffin top. Now here’s where he tripped into a light jog out of my life. He decided to add, “It’s just that my therapist told me that I could tell you that I was more attracted to you when you were exercising and eating better.” And I thought, is your therapist your friend Sean? ‘Cause it sounds like Sean, who also called me crazy for making you wash your hands before sex after riding the subway, but I feel like every surgeon has to scrub in, okay. This was all coming from a very thin person and I never asked him to eat more so it didn’t feel like I was trying to snuggle with a jungle gym, or get fucked by a rhombus. That’s a lot of sharp angles coming at me. Whatever, everybody’s health goals are different. Some people’s health goals are just being able to tell what the diarrhea was from. I think we’re finally in a good place where everybody realizes that being fat doesn’t mean you’re unhealthy and being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy. When I was 200 pounds, I lived with a girl who was a hundred pounds and she would always call herself fat. She was a German shepherd, but like she carried it well. It affects everybody. I know it affects men too. Of course you guys aren’t immune to body image issues, or maybe you have events in mind you’d like to look good for. I remember my sister got married during my bagel years and I made the mistake of comparing myself to one of the other bridesmaids online, which you never want to do, you know it, don’t compare yourself to other people. But I remember thinking I’m going to lose so much weight for this wedding. And then, oh, I didn’t. I just kept being me and I got a last-minute spray tan instead. I just showed up to my sister’s wedding looking insane, just chubby and orange, which at the time was not presidential, okay, this is years prior. Probably started it. I remember one of the other bridesmaids in the party pulled me aside before like the aisle part, and she said, remember Beth, today is about your sister, it’s not about you. I was like, what? I can’t he',\n",
       "  'lp that I’m pulling focus, okay. I’m orange and I have a dark brown upper lip. It sticks to the fur. Thankfully they got a divorce so those photos have been destroyed. It always amazes me whenever my sister gets married. You could look at it negatively. I think it’s a beautiful thing, I do. Do you know how hard it is to put yourself out there, over and over again, and be vulnerable enough to fall in love. I’m a full coward. I’m very noncommittal. If I’m ever at the altar and the pastor says, do you, Beth, take this person to be your whatever. If so, say I do. I’m just going to be like, eh, it’s not that I don’t. I just feel weird saying it in front of everybody. Good news is I come from a very pro-divorce family and my older sister and I, we never liked our middle sister’s first husband. He had a Samsung Galaxy. But I was praying that his would explode over his penis. Is that how religion works, I just started. I may have tweeted something to that effect, and he found the tweet, which I appreciate the follow, brother. But he got very upset and he showed the tweet to my sister. And he said, your sister’s tweeting about my dick getting blown off, with like the rage of a man who plays softball. And I am going to save it and I’m going to read it to the kids to sabotage their relationship with Beth. And I was like, whoa, I can’t believe I got him to read to his kids. My sister tried everything. I don’t know if you’ve ever planned a second or third wedding, but stuff starts flying off the truck. You find yourself cutting corners, saying things like, maybe we don’t need to walk down the aisle. We could already be down there. Or who needs a reception, we’ll just meet at the bar. And the dresses change over time. Your first wedding, you’re in a beautiful ball gown. And eventually you end up in a white business suit just like, this time I’m serious. Now of course, marriage can be a beautiful thing. I’m thankful I don’t feel the pressure to do it, but I love watching my sisters do it. I don’t love all the traditions they’ve kept. Like I don’t enjoy the bride sweepstakes, the giveaway part where our dad walks ’em down the aisle in a white dress. And he’s like, here are the untouched goods, you take care of it. It just feels weird, I don’t want my dad giving me away, like he never had me. I also feel there’s gotta be somebody better suited for the job. I was thinking about it long and hard, and what I came up with was maybe my ex-boyfriend, Nick, will do it, give me away. We had three wonderful years together. I loved him, he loved me. I actually have his name tattooed on my back, so he kind of owes me on this. And I broke up with him, but he’s married now, so maybe he’d like to hear from me. I don’t know. I found out he was married because of Instagram. I still follow his sister, she hasn’t blocked me yet. And she posted this beautiful photo of him and his wife on their wedding day, which I felt like was really in my face. I think if I asked him to do it, he would. And then Nick could walk me down the aisle and we’d get to my almost-husband, and then maybe like one last kiss and then Nick could lean into him and whisper something like there’s a little bit left, you know, or something. I don’t know, I’m workshopping it. I just want somebody to make an honest woman out of me. And then if his wife hates the idea I could offer to get her name tattooed under his. It’s like his name, her name, any children they have, I’m willing to do pets. I should be arrested. I really do have his name tattooed back there. Do you know how hard it is to get laid with another man’s name on your back? Not hard, it isn’t. Never been an issue. Despite everything I’ve said leading up to this point, I do have a relationship with my father. I just called him back yesterday, ’cause he had called me on Father’s Day and I wanted to get back. My parents divorced when I was young and my dad moved down to Orlando, Florida to be an actor, which is not where you go. He did, he eventually landed a role as Blackbeard at Pirate’s Cove mini putt-putt golf course. And when you know celebrities, there are going to be perks. So my two older sisters and I, we would leave our mom in Ohio and go down to Orlando to visit our dad because it was court-ordered. Free putt-putt, baby. My dad would dress like a pirate from here down. And then Alice, the manager at the time, would give my dad this huge',\n",
       "  ' Blackbeard head to put on top of his head that rested on his shoulders. And then he would walk around the mini golf place making people’s time better, question mark. But before my dad’s shift would start and before we ran off, he would pull us aside after we picked out our clubs and he’d gather us around and he’d get very serious and he’d be like, girls, listen up, get over here. Look at me. Listen. When the head goes on, look at me. When the head goes on. I’m not dad anymore. Very method, okay, which from one artist to another, I respected, but I was also the youngest of the three girls. You know when your sisters tell you to shut up? And then two seconds later you’re like, as we go on, we remember, and then they hit you and you’re like, I’m sorry. I forgot, seriously I forgot. So I did, I forgot. And I got a little hole in one and I started yelling for my dad instead of Blackbeard. And he found where the sound was coming from in the head, he was like at a higher hole. And he peeked around this blue waterfall and just looked down at us and shook the whole head, like no. I don’t know if you’ve ever disappointed a parent that has a bigger head on top of their head, but it’s like triple the disappointment. And also a little passive-aggressive, ’cause there’s like a huge smile on the outside of the face, But not on the inside. After that, he could have gone anywhere, Disney, Universal, the mall, but he bucked industry standards and he started his own business that’s called Stars on Call. He describes his work as live roadside commercials or like character directionals. He dresses up in different costumes and he stands in front of businesses that are paying them to get people inside. I’m sure you have people like that here, right? It’s usually like a kid in front of Subway sandwiches with a sign and earbuds and like, fuck my life. My dad blows those assholes out of the water. He’s out there high-kicking. He’s pelvic thrusting. There’s a lot of raising the roof. He’s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Carry Him In. He’s a gorilla in front of Gold’s Gym. He’s a slice of pizza. Has anyone seen my dad? In the Orlando area? Real question, I like to ask, ’cause one time I think I was in Houston, a guy went, yo, is your dad, the fireman in front of Firehouse Subs. And I was like, yes, that’s my maker. He also does a fairly offensive portrayal of a Mexican in front of this place called Tijuana Flats, but he’s been doing it for 29 years, so at this point it is on them. If you call my dad’s number, he’ll answer and he’ll be like Stars on Call, this is Bert. Yeah, you want Chef Big Butt from three to five? No problem, I’ll send a man out. Always him. Nobody else works for that company. He’s a genius. I guess technically his wife. He found somebody to marry him down in Orlando and sometimes she’ll zip up his morph suit. As kids always felt like on our visits, my dad would like consistently choose our stepmom over me and my sisters, and like, I get it. You know, she gave him head and all we had were questions. But my dad has been in Orlando now for so long his personality is very much Fox news. Like, I mean, he’s so MAGA, he’s stealing jobs from the Mexicans. Growing up, we’d have these weekly calls that you have with your divorced parents and he would spew a fairly feminist rhetoric. He would always say, girls, remember to get the education you need to get the job you need, to get the car and the house you need. Then worry about the husband. And then in high school he started calling us and saying things like, if you ever get pregnant, I’ll take the baby. What? I don’t think he meant steal it, I think he meant take it and raise it. I wish more anti-choice people were like him. Like if you have it, I’ll take it. But they’re not, they just want you to have it. And then you never hear from ’em again. No thank you note, no money, it’s rude. I’m sure you’re wondering how hard it must’ve been for my mom to watch my dad go off and become a big star… on call, none-the-less. She’s fine. She’s currently sleeping with this very handsome, cavalier King Charles spaniel. His name is Nigel. She loves him. I feel like all he does is just try to eat her food and put his dick on our good pillows. I’ve been replaced. She sort of… She likes to update me on what they’re up to if they’re hanging and stuff. One time she sent me a photo of Nigel on the front ',\n",
       "  'porch. You know when a dog like splays their back legs out equally. So the hind is like, peuwww, you know what I mean? I better do it. Sorta like, when the dog is like fully flat, just like you know what I mean, it’s like penis to pavement, just like cooling his dick off on the cement. My mom sent me a photo of Nigel like this on the front porch, in the caption she wrote, it’s pretty hot here. I was like, ew. Is this a sext? Is this Nigel? My mom… Can you just imagine the dog, like ticka-ticka-tick… My mom has been out of the game for a while. I took her on a retirement trip and we were out to eat, we must have run out of things to talk about ’cause at the end of the meal I asked my mom, have you ever gotten a dick pic? She goes a nickel? I was like, what? Never mind, I don’t know why I even asked you that. Is anybody here with their mom? Oh you, good, I love it when people come with their mom, especially if I talk about something sexual, it’s so fun to look at you guys, because you’re usually like, I don’t know, are we laughing? Which I chalk up to like a sexual spectrum of mother, how moms raise their kid in regard to sex. ‘Cause on one side of the sexual spectrum, some moms are like, sex does not exist. And then their kids go away to college and they’re like, yes it does. And then there are moms on the opposite side of the sexual spectrum who say things like, hi honey, how was your orgasm? And you’re like, ew. I will not be coming home for Thanksgiving. Thankfully I didn’t have to deal with that. My mom is 100% a virgin. When she does start dating, I’m going to have to ask her like, how was your date? And then she’ll say, I don’t know, we were kissing, and then his penis got sharp. I don’t have to explain it to my mom. My sisters, on the other hand, love to bone. They like to have sex, get fertilized, wait for it to go from embryo, to fetus, to baby. And then they birth the baby. It’s like their thing. Whenever my oldest sister’s pregnant, her husband likes to announce it, and he’ll always say, “We’re pregnant!” Which has historically irked some people because they feel like the woman is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I, however, have turned a corner and I like it, I do. ‘Cause it did, it took two people to do that thing, which is why I like to practice with all the men in my crowd before we go. I just like to practice saying we’re pregnant on three. So all the men in the crowd on three, we’ll say, “we’re pregnant.” One, two, three. We’re pregnant. Okay, you’re also drunk. Not everybody did it. If that didn’t resonate with you, I guess you could just go home and practice. We’re aborting. That’s honestly where we could use your help the most. For some reason, the stigma of abortion is just fully on a woman, it’s bonkers. Back where I’m from in Ohio, they were talking about putting a woman in prison if she gets an abortion and I’m like, eh, she had an accomplice. We haven’t had a Mary since that first one. And even then you’re telling me that God stopped at one kid. The self-restraint there is admirable. Like God just had Jesus and then we lost him. You think he’d try again. I just feel like mortal men, sometimes it feels like mortal men, you’re more careful pouring a beer than you are with your jizz. Just like, ooh, ooh, not too much head. It is like the only time you say that. And then privately you’re just spreading biomedical hazard, like…gooogggg I don’t blame you. Nobody teaches enough about this stuff. Some people don’t even like hearing the word abortion. But as long as birth control is hard for a lot of people to get and boners are hard to keep in condoms, they’re going to happen. I think we just got to stop looking at abortion like leftovers. Hear me out, keep breathing through the joke. Imagine it like this. Like a couple goes out for a big meal and they over-order, they’re reckless, they’re probably wasted. And at the end of the meal, there’s a bunch of leftovers and the dude says, you take them. And the woman says, oh, I don’t want them, you take them. And the dude says I can’t, I don’t have a fridge. And she asks then why did you put it in the box? You shouldn’t have put it in the box. Now we’re going to have to throw it away. And the dude says, “Okay, do you want me to like walk you to a trash can?” And then for some reason on the way to the trash can, there’s only random people yelling at her, like, “You wasteful bit',\n",
       "  'ch!” She’s like, what, he paid for half? I’m just saying abortion is not really the time to go Dutch, maybe treat her. And of course there’s a lot of good men out there. I was living in Bloomington, Indiana, and I saw a man praying in front of the Planned Parenthood. And I imagined that he was just saying like, dear God, please make sure that Brenda came here on Wednesday when she said she would. So there’s some good ones. Whenever my sisters are pregnant at the same time– like that’s happened simultaneously a couple times– people can’t help themselves, they always ask me like, did they plan it? I’m just like what does that look like for you? Do you think one of my sisters called the other and said, hey, what’s up, what are you doing? And the other was like, I don’t know, what are you doing? No. I don’t know what the season is for unprotected sex, but I think it’s always in Ohio. I have so many nieces and nephews running around, I can’t keep track. Sometimes I just have to wait for them to like play in a group, and then I shout out a name like, “Charlotte” and wait for one to turn. Get over here, let’s connect. I don’t even know what I would name kids if I had them. Obviously Jeremy, your parents struggled. I had a friend who actually named their daughter Harbor because she and her husband conceived her in this beautiful hotel in a harbor, which is truly disturbing. If my family did that, we would have so many Alleys and Sofas. Maybe like one The Woods, I’m from Ohio. And then what, they’re just supposed to call me mom? There’s already so many. I didn’t even know my mom had a first name until recently. I’d just been calling her mom for so long. And then she phoned me up and asked why haven’t you followed me back on Instagram? I was like, who’s Diane? I don’t even know if I would respond to mom. I’ve been called a female comic Ss many times I’d respond better to girl daddy. Just imagine my future imaginary son, like the last to get picked up, at probably afternoon kindergarten. And his teacher walks over to him and asks, Van, is your mother coming? And then he’ll be like, no, my girl dad is, she’s just always late. She’s probably picking up my sister, Shallow Grave. You guys have been so great. Thank you for listening.

       " ['[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have',\n",
       "  ' the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut o',\n",
       "  'ff, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that wa',\n",
       "  'lked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no u',\n",
       "  'p and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen.',\n",
       "  ' So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac!',\n",
       "  ' How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, ',\n",
       "  'but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork c',\n",
       "  'hop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while',\n",
       "  ', you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

       " ['Dylan Moran’s What It Is (2009) offers a sweeping exploration of human foibles, societal observations, and the complexities of life through the lens of stand-up comedy. Moran navigates topics ranging from the absurdity of consumerism, the nuances of language barriers, and the cultural peculiarities of different countries, to personal anecdotes about aging, relationships, and the quest for happiness amidst life’s mundane realities. He explores the human condition with a mix of cynicism and whimsy, using his unique blend of eloquence and humor to critique modern life while also reflecting on the universal struggle for meaning and connection. Through his performance, Moran invites the audience into a world where laughter serves as a coping mechanism for the existential dread that pervades our daily lives, encouraging a collective introspection on what it truly means to be human in a rapidly changing world. * * * (HELP ME BY JUNIOR WELLS PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome to the stage Dylan Moran? (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Hello! You’re here. Hello, hello. Uh… I don’t know! You know, you come in, wanting stuff. I don’t know what you want. I don’t know what anybody wants. I don’t know what I want. MAN IN AUDIENCE: We want you. Yeah, yeah. You say that. I get that, you know. Where’s the cake? Cake is the language of love. I don’t see any cakes in the building. You know, people say that to you in your life. They go, “I love you, I love you.” Yeah? Give me a fucking éclair. Nobody… No, we don’t need to eat any more, anyway. You know, people in the English-speaking nations generally don’t. Even the poor. We’re all overfed. Eating is a purely recreational thing now. So why fuck around with soup, or chicken, or any of that stuff? Just cake. I live in Scotland. Have you been to Scotland? See, that’s the exact same number of people as answer that question in the affirmative when I ask it in England. And people… English people don’t go up there, it’s nearly half the country, and they don’t go up, and you say, “Why don’t you go?” And they go, “Oh, well, you know, it’s very dark and dreary.” ‘Cause they get so used to the crocodiles and the tropical storms down there in England and they… “Dark and dreary, you can’t understand the accent, the food’s disgusting, a lot of violence, a lot of drugs, people injecting Temazepam into each other’s stumps and… Otherwise I’d go, you know.” It’s nonsense, anyway. It’s a beautiful accent in Scotland. There’s a lot of Scottish people here in this country. You know the voice. You’ve heard it before. It’s very easy to understand. Before I was in Australia, the last place I was in was in Glasgow. I was in an off-licence buying some cigarettes, blending in with the local women and children and I… There was a young man in front of me, very friendly, with a whole case of beer balanced on his stomach. And he turned round to me and he said, (MUMBLING INCOMPREHENSIBLY) And I didn’t quite know what was on offer, but that doesn’t stop you joining in a conversation. You just take out your best middle-class smile, you know, and go… (LAUGHING) He could have been asking me anything, I don’t know. It’s kind of an abuse of a smile though, really, ’cause smiles are important. They should be used for, you know, when you really mean something, you feel it very deeply. This is just one of those “please don’t kill me, I’m just off a train” smiles. And Scottish people are quite bigoted about the English. You know, I have to remind them of the incredible English sophistication and tolerance and sense of humour, which they need to deal with their impotence and pointlessness. Then there… There is no point being sensitive about where you’re from because it doesn’t matter, you know? I mean, Irish people, very recently, were voted one of the ugliest people in the world. That didn’t bother me. It just made me look a bit harder at Irish people. I can see what it’s about. We’re a pretty rugged bunch. All Irish people look like they’re trying to hide other people inside them. Even newborn babies have that look. Like they’ve had a serious go at an international rugby career at some point. It doesn’t matter, at all. You know, everybody is in the same position. Looking for, trying to look for something, anything to believe in. Here, you have… Your prime minister has an approval rating of 75%. Which is… What’s he doing? Nobody ever gets 75%. Is he coming round at night with a pot roast, touching you on the knee and telling you you’ve lost weight? What’s going on? This is madness. Nobody gets 75%. Not even when you’re madly in love with somebody and you’re both fucking each other’s brains out, do you give each other 75%. You’ve got to hold a bit back, keep the other person guessing, you know. Keep it at a steady 40. And since I’ve been here, you know, there’s a lot of talk in Sydney and a couple of other places about the whole biking problem, which is, as far as I’m concerned, kind of a problem about language. Now, most people obviously on their motorcycles just… It’s a very good place to be on a motorcycle. It’s a great country to see, you know, from a bike, going, “Look, there’s… Never mind.” And the… ‘Cause the, you know, it goes on for ages but… And then you get a few people who happen to have motorcycles, but who are mainly violent lunatics. Who, um, who would be violent lunatics if they had a kite. And they… Or just a rubber duck, they’d still be insane. The thing is, you can’t deal with the public because of what you call them. Because you call them bikies, which is a really Australian thing where you diminutise everything, you know, you make an “ee”. Everything you put a little “ee, ee, ee, ee” on everything. You can’t address the problem like that. “Oh, it’s a bikie. He’s coming at me with a knifey. “I’m in the morguey.” And then you do this other weird stuff, like with words that are really short, you make them unnecessarily longer. Like “yes” you turn into “yeeeeeah”. Or “noooooo”. Which is the exact same sound you get if you put something up, or indeed take it out, of a cat. And, uh, language here is… It’s kind of a, kind of a… you know, worldwide, it’s the same here as it is in lots of Europe as well. Much more Americanised. I mean, you really notice that now. They, you know, 50 years, 20 years ago, Jesus, 10 years ago, people would’ve said, somebody would’ve said something like, “Well, you know, I was quite nervous about seeing him, actually, “but in the end he was very quick to reassure me and we had a lovely evening.” Now, that’s just become, “I was like ‘uh’, he was like ‘duh’.” Something’s lost there. Now, I don’t know why I’m talking about that, ',\n",
       "  'but anyway, the um… Yes, you see the thing is, it doesn’t matter where you’re from. It’s that they’re talking about the recession here. They’ve just begun that. And it’s a very boring subject, but you’ve no idea how boring it is. ‘Cause it’s only just started here. For months, they just, you know, they sort of went, (GARBLED) “…recession.” There’s a little, “Yeah, don’t have that other slice of cake just yet.” But that’s been going on in Europe for months and months and months. People, you know… And then everybody ignored it ’cause it started out, they’re going, “There seems to be a bit of a recession, a slight… Yeah. Anyway, next news, there was a dog who got sick on somebody,” and all that stuff. And then the next day they come out with, “Actually, it’s quite bad. It’s crisp.” “Yeah. Oh. Fuck it,” and then the next day it was just… You know, nobody watches the news now ’cause all the newsreaders are in rags and you turn it on and they’re going… (GROANING) “A baby sold its eyes to pay for its teeth.” (GROANING) It’s too fucking depressing. People don’t read the newspapers any more, they just run home and beat the televisions with them. I don’t know why I’m doing this. I’m just prepared, you know? Um… (STUTTERING) The… Yeah, I don’t know. I mean, I don’t. My mind is going, anyway, I’ve been here a long time. I’ve been on the road for too long. I know I have, ’cause I was in a supermarket the other day and I saw this… I saw this tiny, heartbreaking can of beans. And it really made me want to cry. I just thought, “How old or sick or small do you have to be to need those beans?” And it was on a high shelf, you know? You’d be climbing the ladder for days just to get at those four beans. These are beans that somebody else would have to feed you ’cause of the huge accident you just had, you know? You pop them in with a bean-shooter through the gap in a person’s teeth when they’re up in plaster of Paris lying in the bed there, and you go… One bean for every day in the week. So, yeah, it’s been a while. And the, um… But that is absolutely true about, you know, people needing to believe in things. And it’s a scary thing when you start to believe in politicians. You can’t trust them. You see, but we need to believe something. And you’re not allowed to believe in religion. Well, you can, but people will laugh at you and throw things. ‘Cause it was just sort of decided in the 20th century that religion is basically a formalised panic about death. That’s all. I mean, look at the Catholic Church, the campest organisation on the planet, with the purple robes, gold bits on the side, jewellery so big if they let it fall it will kill people. What else can it be but this sort of ritual of panic about death? “Death is coming! Quick, put on the gold hat.” They’re… You see, people never really grow up. I don’t mind most religious people. I talk to them. You know, I listen to them banging on. “I prayed very hard and then the fairy came.” “Did he? Good. Have a biscuit.” I only get annoyed when they try and make me see the fairy. “You have to let the fairy into your heart.” “Look, I wouldn’t let him into my garden, okay? “I’d shoot him on sight, if he existed, which he doesn’t. “Now, have another biccie and be quiet, will you, please?” But you can absolutely understand the desire to believe in something to support you, you know? I mean, children like to be supervised by adults, you know, that’s why children go, “Look, no hands,” or, “Look, I can do this.” “Look, I’m really good at this,” whatever it is. ‘Cause it validates them. It shows them that they are there, ’cause somebody else is watching over them. Grownups are the same. Not that there is any such thing as a grownup, really. They want to be, the idea they like to be watched by something, you know. ‘Cause, I mean, the planet’s not going to miss us when we finish fucking it up and killing each other. So we needed the idea of God to have somebody to miss us, or at least notice that we weren’t there any more. ‘Cause we’ve all died out, ’cause we’ve fucked it up. And God will go, “Look, they’re not there. The lizards are doing quite well, though. “Good on them.” But we’re sort of gradually growing out of that now. You know, I passed a church a couple of days ago and saw one of those signs you see outside churches, it said, “Jesus said, ‘I am the light of the world.”‘ Which is very male view. You know, if Jesus had been Jesusina, it would have been more modest. You know, ’cause it’s a woman. It would traditionally have to be more modest. Jesusina would have gone, “Well, I’m quite bright.” And because, uh, you know, ’cause you have dreams, they need to go somewhere, so they go into belief and thus we get very extreme people, obviously, in any religion. But with suicide bombers, one of the things I don’t understand is what’s in it for the women suicide bombers? ‘Cause with the men, it’s a very male kind of promise at the end of it. “Seventy-two virgins.” A man, I think, thought of that. And, um… But I bet you what women are offered is much more modest. It’s probably, you know, flexible working hours and decent childcare at the end of it, something like that. But anyway, look. So you don’t, people don’t believe in religion any more. What do they believe in? You can’t go to politics. You can’t. Look at them. For fuck’s sake. Look at Vladimir Putin. How can you? He cultivates the idea of being a gangster. He just loves it. How can you trust anybody who looks like they’ve been cloned from a dead shark? Or Berlusconi in Italy, right? The envy of the world, Italy, in terms of history, art and culture. Ninety-eight different political parties and they still managed to elect him. He so fucking crooked he sleeps on a spiral staircase. So thoroughly corrupt, every time he smiles, an angel gets gonorrhoea. He’s had so many facelifts his face has moved to the top of his head, you have to get on a stepladder to watch him lie. You can’t trust any of them. And we all think that we’re very rational and very secular. But we make gods all the time. Everybody went apeshit when Barack Obama got elected. I was delighted. Everybody was thrilled. A sane, rational, intelligent human being in an important office. Great. But his biggest problem is everybody else, is us. ‘Cause everybody’s in love with him. He stands up there, he’s very convincing and commanding, and makes sense, says it’s a difficult time, everybody needs to work together and be realistic about what we’ve got to do and all that stuff. And everybody is looking at him going, “No! You do it! “You are Super Jesus. “You’re so handsome when you’re serious. “Do you work out?” And, uh… Where else can you go? I mean',\n",
       "  ', you know, people talk about technology and science all the time. But that’s bollocks. People come in here with their fucking camera phones, everything is a camera nowadays. You pick up a piece of fruit, it takes a picture of you. Or the computers, which are everywhere, which is proof that we like to be watched. That’s what we replaced God with, technology. We’re fucking afraid to be alone in a lift, in a taxi cab. We need cameras everywhere, recording us, unless we realise we’re alone, we might do something scary. Like whimper, I don’t know. But then… The machines… You know, the laptop I have, all it does is tell me to fuck off in 400 different ways, I don’t understand it. You open it up and it goes, “Ba-jing! What’s the magic word?” I don’t know. That’s why I got you. I have no memory. Don’t go fucking “ba-jing” anyway, why can’t you be more like me? When I open you up, you should go… (GARBLING) “What?” And science… is a joke. Look at the scientific explanation for the origin of life as we know it. It has a major flaw. I mean, it’s no wonder we have creationists. You know, those people, God love them, who tell their children that, you know, originally, we all went to school with the dinosaurs, or whatever it is that they tell them. But no wonder they exist because listen to the explanation for the origin of life itself. It doesn’t sound very scientific. There was a big bang. And then we all came from monkeys. “What, that’s it?” “Yeah, shop’s closed, fuck off.” I need more than that. There must be more than, bang! (IMITATING MONKEY) “Honey, I’m home!” Come on! It’s such a boring theory, anyway. It’s much more interesting if you reverse the order. So, there’s that and then the other thing that we seem to have bought into in a big way is consumerism. That’s what people use, they fill the void, you know, stuff. Give me the thing, give me the couch, the wig, the tiny beans, the radio, the CDs, the fricking shoes, all the stuff, all the time, that you can’t get away from. You know you bought a lot of shit ’cause you’re broke now. And your house is full of shit. You walk around the house looking for a pencil or a piece of paper, you can’t find anything useful like that but you can always put your hands on a purple furry cube with the number six on the side and rubber legs underneath. And you pick it up and you go, “What is this shit? Why is it in the house?” ‘Cause you bought it, that’s why. Like all the other crap you never use. There’s people in the middle of Sydney driving around in those huge 4×4 vehicles. They’re like little houses on the move. You can’t even see the people inside, they’re so high up. The man on the mobile phone is going, “Blah, blah, blah!” about money. Or the ladies with the Roman candle of blonde hair going, “Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!” As they plough through schoolchildren. Roaring around. (ROARING) Up and down the street where your children play in their fucking Toyota Hiroshimas. So they can get to the mall quicker to buy more shit, to put it in the house! The jewellery, the clothes, the perfume. Perfume is a good example of a product gone all wrong. When I was a child, that was a sort of semi-exotic thing, you know? And it was called something stupid, like Fleur de Fleurs. And you would give it to your mother or an auntie at Christmas. And it was advertised by some dopey-looking woman in a field of sunflowers. And she looked like she’d been hit by a tractor because she was going… She just couldn’t get over how nice she smelled. Now, because we’re so jaded, we’ve consumed so much, our attention can only be grabbed in a violent way. So it’s always advertised by these constipated, exoskeletal bitches who are sneering at you. And it’s called something horrible like Homicide. Dysentery. Urban Dysentery, for boys and girls. What’s wrong with us? We’re the only organism the planet is actively asking to fuck off by burning things and freezing things and melting things on us. It’s like going past the ocean and seeing it spit out whales. “Fuck off, I’ve had enough of you.” Passing the eucalyptus tree as the koalas hang on. The tree’s going, “Get the fuck away from me!” Now, you’re in the forefront of all that because you’ve got real weather here. Dramatic weather. You open your front door and everything might be gone, or you might be two and a half miles further on down the road, in a flood. In Britain and Ireland, where people talk about the weather all the time, all day, there’s no story, there’s no weather. But Irish people, especially, insist on drama. So you can hear things like, “Oh, it was fierce mild! It was touch and go there for a while.” So… God doesn’t work. Science doesn’t work. Consumerism certainly doesn’t work. So where do you go? Where do you end up? We end up back with each other, there’s nowhere else to go. People. You have a very important, early decision to make in your life. Are you going to be alone, or are you going to be with somebody else? Are you going to be sane, or not Ionely? A couple is a strange thing. It’s an organism that’s half as intelligent as the most intelligent member. And you both know who that is. ‘Cause you’ve got two people walking around together all the time, trying to remember all the different shit they have to lie about to each other. “Oh, we’re going over here, are we? Oh, good, are we going to see those people? “Terrific, oh good, hope it doesn’t stop any time soon.” There’s a lot of pressure on you to find the right person. You’re told if you don’t find the right person your life is fucked. You might as well forget the whole thing. You’re dead! Which is rubbish, there’s billions of you. We’re all the fucking same. It’s not him it’ll be her, or if not him it’ll be them. There’s millions of people for everybody. There’s more than enough. We’re very overstocked on ourselves. But it’s because we all think we’re so fabulous. The first half of your life is all spent getting over yourself, anyway. You know, you would think you’re amazing, unique. Young people walking around going, “You know the funny thing is “I was just in the kitchen but now I’m here in the bedroom. “Get a load of me. I just go on and on.” And that’s around the age when you meet somebody else and you’re totally unbearable. Two young, fit, healthy, attractive people in love? There’s nothing worse to look at in the world. Going around going, “I can’t believe I met you ’cause I’m amazing and you’re amazing, and we’re surrounded by shitheads. “It’s just amazing. “Hey, I know this really good bar. Let’s go and make it better.” In the second half of your life you realise just how like every other hump who drew breath you really are, except you’re more boring. B',\n",
       "  'ut anyway, so there’s a lot of pressure. There’s pressure on a young man to say something snappy and seductive and charming to a young woman in a dance hall or a disco or whatever they’re called now, those places where you walk in and the music makes your internal organs bleed. And it’s very hard ’cause it’s a loaded conversation. It’s about attraction. So, what do you say? You know, what’s the right thing to say? There’s nothing. It’s like talking to the bereaved. There’s no right thing to say. “Hey. “Yeah. Like your clothes and stuff. “You want some gravy?” There’s no… Gravy is not an innuendo. I just mean actual gravy. The, um… Yeah. Fuck, where are you from? The… You know, it’s the same with the bereaved. What can you say? “I am sorry about all the people who died. “Want a little gravy?” It doesn’t work then, either, you know? But there’s too much pressure on you because you’re young and you’re stupid. You should be given some latitude, some licence there. You know, you should just be allowed to walk up and say, “Hey,” and then you can go off together. And do something wonderfully stupid. Like have a gap year. Why not? There’s no other justification for that as far as I can see, anyway. What do young people have gap years for? They haven’t done anything yet. Why don’t they have a full year where they do nine times as much as they’ve ever experienced up to that point? So they know what the rest of adulthood feels like? Which is walking around in a desert with a bag over your head, being bumped into by people who rob you as they bore you. And they always go for some stupid reason as well. “So, where are you going?” “Brazil.” “You bastard. Why?” “‘Cause they have a snake there. “And what it does, it pretends to be asleep and then monkeys come over. “And then it fucks them and eats them.” And… “Well, have a great time in jail with malaria.” The… So, yeah, all that pressure on the young man and the young woman and there’s, you know, tremendous amounts of different kinds of pressure on the young man and the young woman because 7,000 women in Britain alone went for cosmetic breast surgery last year, which is… You think, “Why?” I mean, a tiny number of them might have needed some medical attention. The rest just thought they weren’t good enough. You know, they needed something else, big, small, square. Maybe wrap-around. (ROLLS TONGUE) I don’t know. But… You must be pretty insecure to go to a surgeon and say, “What I want you to do is put me to sleep with powerful drugs. “While I’m asleep, rip, snip, Frisbee away different bits of me, stick in two weather balloons, sew it up, wait until I’m groggy and deranged and bloody and wake me up and then give me demands for money.” You know, you can’t think that much of yourself. You know, nobody’s tits are perfect. Not even mine, and I have spent thousands on every inch of myself. These fingers are from Florence. Yves Saint Laurent himself designed my arse. My nipples are reconstructed from an early, unfinished blueprint by Coco Chanel. Hence, their lopsided charm. One of them is on my shoulder. The other five I keep handy between my toes, which themselves are a bit embarrassing but fuck it, it was the ’80s, you had to have suede. And the… Nothing is perfect. So the young man and the young woman… realise eventually that you don’t die, you know, it’s a huge lie. ‘Cause the young man knows he’s not dead, ’cause he’s with the young woman now. And they’re in a rented flat, and she’s talking about curtains. And he really, really wants to be dead. ‘Cause the young woman’s been talking about curtains for half an hour and looks like she means to go on, and she’s saying, “What do you think? “Should we get the purple ones with the really subtle blend “into the pink tonalities towards the end? “Or should we get the ones where they look like a tree? “But it’s at night and you’re passing in a car. Which one do you think we should get? “What do you really feel? I can’t make this decision by myself. “What do you really, truly feel?” And what he really truly feels is, “I cannot begin to describe how much I don’t care! “I didn’t know we had windows “until you brought all this shit up, okay?” Stop saying “wallpaper”, “furniture”, “floor”. It’s bourgeois. Eat the chicken from my hat, come on. Now, in a strange way, when you’re young, death is on your mind more. You don’t think about it. You don’t think about anything. You know, I was young once. I remember. You don’t think about anything. You’re very stupid. Young men in particular are very stupid ’cause they’re paralysed by lust. You’d like the luck to spend your time looking at young women, going, “Ahh! Ahhh! Oh, oh, ah! “Please! Please, let me help you, please. “Take me home. I could hold parts of you while the rest of you gets on with tasks. “Please! Come on.” Stand on the same street corner for days at a time. Now, I still see them, of course. Sometimes I still stop and stare. But different things go through my mind now with time passing, you know? I look at them and I go, “Ahh! “Ha-ha! “Give me your kidneys. “You’re wasting them! “Fucking fruit and salad. Come on, I need backup here. “I’ll give you a pair of shoes.” So, yes. Death. When you’re young, you think about it. You don’t really think about it, you know. You have the intelligence of raspberry jam. You’re not thinking about anything. But it’s there as a mode of force, making you do things. Go and get a job, go and find a flat. Find somebody else. Put them in the flat. Make them stay. Get a toaster. Go to work. Get on the bus. Look at your boss. Say “fuck”. Sit down. Pick up the thing. Go blank. Scream internally. Go home. Listen to the radio. Look at the other person. Think, “Why, why did this happen?” Go to bed. Lie awake, at night. Get up. Feel groggy. Put the things on, your clothes, whatever they’re called. Go out the door. In to work. Same thing, same people again. It’s real. It is happening to you. Home again. Sit. Radio. Dinner. Hmm. Gardening, gardening, gardening! Death. So… (AUDIENCE WHOOPING) The young woman thinks if she can get the right curtains, she can keep death and all attendant problems at bay. But the young man knows that the only way to keep death at bay is to have sex pretty much constantly. Now, because nature’s so clever, it makes the couple compromise by giving them children, so they never need to have sex again, and then the children pull the curtains down. So there was nothing to worry about in the first place. If they do have children… Now, if you don’t have children, if you’re a young man and you don’t have children, you won’t give a shit about anything I’m about to say for about the next five minutes, probably. ‘',\n",
       "  'Cause young men especially, all men, in fact, don’t even see children. They’re just other beings that want instant gratification. They’re competition as far as men are concerned. Children are part of a woman’s life from when she’s very young. She’s brought up to look after other people. So, you know, I was aware of that going out with people in my 20s. You’d be walking along the street with somebody and the woman would go, “Oh, look at that! Look at this tree. Isn’t that beautiful? You could put a baby up there.” Men don’t see them. Until they have one, and then, only when they’re just about to step on them. “Oh! Sorry about that! Sorry about that. What’s that?” “Wah wah”? They want you. They want your something. One of your stuff. And, uh, children obviously change everything, you know, ’cause men have a very narrow focus a lot of the time, especially when they’re doing something… (BUZZING) So, you know, men like plans. I like… You think you do that and then that and then that could happen. So, if you go on holiday with a child, you might think, “Oh, let’s go to the old part of the town. Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. “We’ll go where they have cobblestones and cafés and art galleries and it’ll be really good and we’ll walk around and it’ll be fantastic. “And then we’ll go and we’ll have some kind of nice lunch “in a bistro or something and it’ll be great.” And then the child goes, “Daddy, Daddy, look! A stick!” And you go, “Yeah. Well, we’re going over there to the old part of town ’cause there’s this little place, we’ll go there.” “No, look! The stick is beside some poo.” And you think, “Well, yeah, you’re right! “Fuck it. Let’s make a day of it here. We’ll get a picnic. Why move?” But that takes time. Now, if you… They teach you to how to become a person, really. Because, you know, children are very overprotected now in lots of ways. We’re very nervous about them. Um, you know, people go, “Oh, don’t go outside! “Or inside. Get into the cupboard with some spinach.” And when I was a child, they would kick you out of the house and you weren’t expected to come back till there were bats. Um… So children are kind of… I think they’re neurotic now, they’re scared, you know? They go, “Ahh, a ghost!” And, um… If you have friends who don’t have kids, they can sound very naive, you know? Your single friends without children or people without children, ’cause they ask you stupid things like, “What did you do at the weekend?” “Uh…” As you try to distinguish one moment from any other in the blur of screams, stains and tears that made up Saturday and Sunday, they will tell you what they did, which is all they ever wanted to do in the first place. “We went to that really cool place, you know the one you haven’t heard of? Yeah, they make their own tomatoes out of vodka? It was great. And then we walked along the canal. We hired one of those hop-on, hop-off hot air balloons, just so in case we got bored walking, you know, we could go in the balloon for a bit and then we could walk for a bit. And then, you know, I think we saw some French double-bill of old movies. Which reminded us we hadn’t had sex in about a half an hour. So we did again. And then we went and we did that, you know, we’re both in a band. Yeah, it’s doing really well. It’s called Black Yogurt. We did this sort of lunchtime gig. And… In that really, really cool place, you know, the cellar that’s above the building. It’s… It’s called Umlaut. Well, it’s not called Umlaut, it’s just two dots over a U that isn’t there. And then… Saw loads of people from all over the world and saw several art galleries and went to about five operas and some production of ballet. It was really good. I think I was in it. And then we had sex again and… Yeah, then we just ended the evening with some of that Japanese pizza. It’s on stilts. It’s really nice.” And then… And then it comes back to you what you did. You go, “Oh, yeah, I remember. I scraped hardened Weetabix off a kitchen tabletop for two and a half hours and then I tried to have a shit. It didn’t quite work out but there’s a window on Wednesday, I think. You should come round. We’ll make an evening of it.” But before any of that can happen, the couple get a chance to celebrate their togetherness in the new life, if they’ve chosen to be together. And one of the big ways people do that is by torturing each other with the English language, because it’s cheap and available, or indeed any language that they know how to speak. Um, people will kill you over time. They will shave out every last morsel of fun in you with little, harmless-sounding phrases that people use every day. Like, “Be realistic! Can’t you just for half a second be realistic?” Now, what that means is, “See reality my way or die!” Which is why you end up in a warehouse, choosing a toilet, for the entire weekend. And nobody ever said to anybody, “Be realistic. Let me oil you.” Sometimes it’s just, you know, insulting. “It’s all sex with you, isn’t it? Eh?” “No. No, it’s not. No. I resent that. Sometimes I want a snack during.” Sometimes it is fiendishly clever. Like, “Why are you in a bad mood?” See, that’s genius. You have to break that down to understand it. Somebody has said to you, “Why have you chosen to feel awful, thereby making me aware of you? Because I have no choice in the matter. And why do I continue to live with you, even though you are so gravely mentally ill and I don’t get any government money.” First thing in the morning, when nobody should be speaking, my wife says things like, “You look terrible!” “What? Am I sick?” “No, no. You just look old and terrible. Morning, morning.” “That’s an awful thing to say to somebody!” “It’s because I care about you. Don’t say hello to the children, you’ll frighten them. Sort yourself out upstairs.” But you get to hear really good things as well, like, you know, the phrases that would have just died out otherwise, like, eh… “How dare you!” Straight from Victorian theatre. People love talking like that. They feel 12 feet tall. “How dare you!” Running home from work to find the other person, they go, “Where are you? I know you’re here somewhere. There you are. How dare you!” “What the fuck do you mean ‘how dare I’? Have you got a raygun in your pocket or something? Shut up.” My favourite one is, “I know what you’re thinking!” “Oh, do you? Do you really? Well done. I know what you’re thinking, too. I know what everybody’s thinking. They’re thinking, ‘I’d like to be lying face down in a cushion, with my mouth full of chocolate, and something lovely happening to my lower half. Do you want your prize now or later?” But there is something going on right now in the world, which means th',\n",
       "  'at I think things, guys are changing. Men. Now, they don’t want… Basically, there’s loads of it here. I’ve noticed loads of it in this country. And there’s loads of it where I live. And you look at them and it just hit me one day very forcefully. They don’t want to grow up, ’cause they’re wearing children’s clothes. You know, I see loads of guys and they are in their 30s and 40s, shuffling around in t-shirts with you know, “Zap” or “Pow” or whatever on it. And they’ve got ambiguous length trousers. They’re not shorts, they’re not trousers. They’re just these things that say, “I don’t want an executive position anytime soon, okay? “I’m having a milkshake for about the next 10 years. “Stay the fuck away from me.” And they hang around together with another guy and they’re not romantically involved. And they stay inside, these are men, remember, inside the house, playing video games! I think this is amazing. You know what I mean. Bip, bip. Bip, bip. I don’t understand the names of them but you know, a world of bip. Bip, bip, bip. (SLURPING) Milkshake, bip. Zap, bip, bip, bip, bip. A few generations ago, at this age they would have been dead by now. And they’re going, “Bip! Dude, you got more bips than me. “I am so gay.” So, women are having children much later. Do you know the average age of a woman having a child in this country? Do you? Eighty-nine years old. That’s right! Waiting for these fucks to grow up. ‘Cause what have they got to pass on to their children? Apart from “Watch out for the snakes on level six.” What is the… Oh, bloody… Right. Um, I have to go now so that you can go and have a something. Do you want a something? AUDIENCE: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right, then. Go and have something, I’ll see you shortly. Thank you, bye. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Okay, what did you do in the interval? (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) Something nice. That’s what people do, that’s what everybody does. You have to do something nice. (STUTTERING) I can’t remember what I did. But it was nice. Oh, yeah. I ate some chocolate. I’m going to eat some more. Um, you know, you have to have a good relationship with pleasure. Australians seem to, on the whole. Your approach seems to be to go, “What’s that? “Ah, yeah, it’s one of those.” Which is a lot healthier than the Irish one, which is to go, “What’s that? That looks nice. “I’ll wait till everyone’s asleep, “then I’ll steal it, “so nobody will see me enjoy myself and then I won’t have to feel ashamed. “I can just let the guilt fester for the rest of my life and spend all of my remaining years drunk.” But if you want to see a really twisted attitude to pleasure, you have to be talking to an English person, because they’re very strange. They get very coy and very childish around pleasure. You offer an English person something and they go… (LAUGHING) “Well then, if we’re going to be a little bit naughty, “go on, then, I’ll have a nibble.” And you think, “It’s a fucking bun. Eat it! “I’m not offering you flamingo fucking genitals “flash-fried in orchid oil here.” You have to be honest about all that stuff. Otherwise you’ll go strange. You’ll turn into one of those people you don’t like. You know, one of your friends. The one you ring up and say, “Hi, how are you?” And they go, “I’m fine.” (GIGGLING) And you think, “No, you’re not. “You’re making very inappropriate noises on the phone. “You need to sleep with twins, today.” There is a young woman who works in my local grocery shop. And I don’t go in there any more ’cause she’s so repressed. She speaks to me the same way she speaks to everybody else. You go in there and you put your grapes or butter or whatever it is you’re getting in front of her and she goes, “Hi. How are you?” (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) And you think, “I’m fine. This relationship has gone way beyond its parameters already. “I can’t get involved in all the murders you need to commit “to get this shit out of your system. “Please go and do something you enjoy soon before you kill everybody with a label gun.” You know, I think that women are not allowed to be seen to enjoy themselves in lots of ways. They have a test for that in Ireland now. They’ve scientifically perfected that, the Madonna Whore Quotient of a woman. You know, if when a woman puts her hands together to pray, and when she’s crying the blood and she levitates, if you don’t get a sustained hum in A flat, she’s a fucking whore! We sorted that out. And… You know, if you’re not honest about pleasure, if you’re not honest about what you want, you’ll become strange. You’ll turn into one of those freaks, those people who have hobbies. You know, somebody gets a load of coat hangers and buttons, runs into a shed, you don’t see them for three days and then they come out, going, “Look, the Taj Mahal!” No, it’s not. Put it away. And no, I don’t want to see all the plates you’ve nailed to a bath. Stay away from me, you fucking weirdo! Or the horse you made out of your own hair and spit. Just keep away. There was a time when people were more honest about all that stuff. You know, people creep up on pleasure now in a very odd way. There’s people out there called “furries”. Have you heard of them? MAN: Yes. They dress up as woodland animals. And they meet for tea and biscuits. I don’t know if it’s a sex thing. I hope so. I want to see a giant bilby fuck a giant wombat as much as the next person. But within that relationship you’ve got to be honest and mature. You can’t say to somebody, “I need you to dress up as a bilby. “This isn’t working for me.” They might have spent the last three-quarters of an hour shoehorning themselves into that numbat costume. You have to be respectful. And then there’s the S&M crowd. And that all sounds very odd at first. You know, people… You know the ones, people who like to be nailed and stapled into things. Put in old fridges and left under the stairs for weeks. They love all that. And that sounds odd at first, but it has an emotional logic, ’cause people speak about it and they say, “Well, it makes me feel safe.” You see? I can see where they’re going with that. I mean, you could grow up… I grew up in Ireland and, you know, you learn to feel bad about anything you enjoy. It’s in the air. It’s Catholicism. You know, you see a sunset. You go, “Look at that. “Isn’t that extraordinarily beautiful?” “We’re not allowed.” “Okay, look at the mud. Look at the mud. The mud everywhere, the mud. “I am made of mud. Everything is mud. Mud.” Sunsets were for Protestants. (MAN WHOOPING) But you’re mature and you let go of all that baggage. I don’t mind telling you my thing now. What I quite like, I don’t care who knows it, what I quite like is to get a couple of scoops of mushy peas, ',\n",
       "  'stick one under each arm and fling myself at a brick wall. I don’t know what it is. I just feel wanted, you know? You gotta do a bit of what you enjoy! People were more honest about all this stuff in times gone by. You know, I’m talking about… I’m talking about when men were men and women were women. There was an earlier time when women were also men but they worked it out. Now, this is not nostalgia. I have no time for nostalgia. All that rubbish, people going, “Two dollars for a Mars bar? I remember when…” What! What do you remember? “Fucking slavery. Shut up! “When children had to live underground, turning the big wheels.” No, I’m just talking about a different time. This is when a man would receive a phone call in a pub. On a landline. And it would be for him. Men died in pubs. Sometimes on the phone. Frequently with a large ham under their arm. This is when a man would express a strong opinion on a subject he knew nothing about as a point of honour. And to emphasise his position, he would take off his hat, so you would see his comb-over. Which was nothing to be ashamed of. It might rise in the breeze like a cobra or a live cable, but it belonged to him. Or he might have that very… That haircut you don’t see any more. The very, very thin white hair that you can see through to the flock wallpaper at the back of the man. Wonderful, thin, white hair. People shave it off now ’cause they think it looks cooler. The fools! They’re missing out on this fantastic look of purely theoretical hair. It looks like a thought bubble clinging to the skull. This is also in the time when a woman had women’s things. You would go to some social gathering. A woman wasn’t there, you would enquire after her, “Where is Jeannie?” And be told, “Oh, Jeannie, she has women’s things.” And you respected that. Nobody knew what they were. She could have been at home squirting jam into envelopes. Polishing an onion with her feet. It was none of your fucking business. Knitting a ceiling cosy. Let her get on with it! This was also in the time when a woman, I am talking about a real woman here, had a vanity table in the bedroom. To have somewhere, somewhere, to sit and weep. About all the terrible things done to her by men. ‘Cause women have memories. Short, medium, long. They’ve got it all. A woman remembers something you said 17 years ago! And the way you looked at her just now. And to aid that memory, the woman would open a hat box full of precious things. The Curly Wurly wrapper that meant so much! The bundle of letters too painful to look at or throw away. They have to be kept so they can never be looked at. A 9-speed, duel shaft, triple action… No, that’s a different time, a different time. Women remember, this is why we have a civilisation. A woman looks at a man and says, “You tried that yesterday. It didn’t work then, either.” Men do not have memories. Every woman is an individual walking time capsule. Men don’t know anything. Men don’t know when their lives became so thoroughly awful. When everybody else turned into such a tosser. A man does not know how he came by the half a pie he is holding in his hand. And scientists, those frauds, seize on this and try and use it as proof of the mysteries of human consciousness and the unknowable nature of the brain, which is rubbish. The brain is the simplest organ in the body. It only has three bits. There’s the front bit which is the bit you scratch when you come in at half one in the morning and the person you live with says, “Where the fuck were you?” The middle bit, which tries to come up with the excuse. And the back bit, which plays the last song that was on in the pub. “I was with Ralph. You know Ralph. He smells of cucumber. “You can move it, you can check it. You can do it you can do it at the hop. “Don’t speak to me like that, anyway.” “I got you a fricking present on the way home. “Did you get me a present? Did you? Did you? “You want some pie?” Men are afraid of women. Everybody knows this. Because of all the gender stereotyping that goes on. All the things that you’re supposed to be. It’s why many young men get a very confusing message thrown at them. The model held up to them is this sort of action hero. James Bond figure or any of the actors who are currently in those films, who, you know, are running around going… (POPPING) Women see that, some women. They look at it and they go, “All that violence, it’s disgusting. Fuck me.” And that’s a mixed message for men. A lot of men don’t know how to talk to women. They think of them as so other. You see a lot of men socially in restaurants, they don’t have a fucking clue. They’re frightened. Frightened of the dramatic weather and the moodscape that a woman can inhabit. You see men looking at them. They don’t know how to talk to the other. Bully them or kid-glove them, they don’t know any other way. “Do you want to… “Do you want to go over there? Do you want to go?” “No? No? I don’t know what I was thinking. I read about it in the paper.” “Apparently some other people went over there and they quite liked it.” “What about… What about over here? Over here looks…” “No, no, no. Insanity, I know. “I’m just going to stand like this until you tell me what you want to do.” ‘Cause they’re afraid of a woman’s contempt. And women, as a group, en masse, do show contempt for men, en masse. Now, a woman might be afraid of an individual violent man, which is very sensible. Everybody should be afraid of an individual violent man. But as a group, you know, you hear a lot of contempt about men. “Oh, look. Look at them. “Look, there they go, one of them is trying to do something.” Men are afraid, women are not. And part of it is just about biology. It’s shameful that we still can’t have an intelligent, productive conversation about these ordinary life events. I mean, it’s two-thousand and… And we still can’t. You know, childbirth, menstruation, all of these things, without which we wouldn’t be here. I mean, you know, as a guy, you ask a woman about childbirth, you try and find out more about it. You say, “Well, how bad is it? What are we talking about here?” You know? How painful? Like what? “Long weekend in Adelaide? What are we… What are we talking about here?” And you don’t get an answer, you get anger. And it always starts with the melon. “Imagine a melon coming through your face! “Fucking stay there, I’ll get a melon, don’t move.” And with mood, you know, men are thrown by a woman’s ability to go from saying “You always fucking do that, you piece of shit!” To “Hiya!” That does throw men. But it’s a myth that men don’t have their own version of PMT. Of course they do. Every woman knows this. It’s a very simple expe',\n",
       "  'riment to conduct. All you’ve got to do is be with a man, wait until he starts doing something and then go up and talk to him. “What? What is it now? I’m opening fish fingers, can’t you see? “You come in here, you’re walking on the floor, “breathing the air like it’s yours, talking and talking. I’m doing something! “Look, they’ve fallen on the floor. Are you happy? Are you happy now? “Every time I try and do something for myself, “you carbonise and then shit on my dreams. “You’re just like your whole family. “Why do I even dare to think I could dream, I could imagine, I could hope?” Now, men imagine that they have memories because they sometimes experience violent déjà vu. A man will grip his girlfriend, wife, partner, and say, “We’ve been here before!” “We’re in the supermarket car park.” “Yes, I know, but we’ve been here before.” “We never go anywhere fucking else, as far as I can see.” (CLEARING THROAT) Excuse me. I have a touch of everything. And the, um… But you know, you… The mind disintegrates. Memory… I never had a memory anyway, but the, um… But everything goes, everything goes. Youth goes and everything goes. You know? That’s why I can’t stand younger people. Healthy people. Healthy, young, attractive people, doing what they want. Bending down and getting up in the same afternoon, it’s revolting. Because I remember that. Being that. And the old people get, you know, they sound… People think they’re dull. They’re not dull, you know. They’re not actually dull. Like, when you watch young people in the street and they’re talking, and they’re doing those handshakes that take three-quarters of an hour. With the amazingly redundant language, “Yeah, yo, dog, kicking back with the chill ride.” What the fuck are you talking about? Why can’t you just say hello? You know, you get so old, you’re grateful when somebody says, “Hello, how are you?” You just fucking tell them. You say, “I’m all right. I’ve got piles, but I’m still masturbating.” Obviously, who’s got the energy for masturbation, you know, but you have to put a bit of spin on things, otherwise you’ll depress people. This is why older people have a reputation for being boring. They’re not boring, they’re just honest. You ask an older person how they are, they will tell you. Say, “Well, you know, I’m all right. “But a very important bit of me turned green and fell off the other day. “It was very annoying, I was in the swimming pool. “They had to get it out with one of those little net things. “Gave it to me in a plastic bag. “Now I have to write a letter of apology to all the children who were there, “the fucking Council.” Because youth vanishes on you. It’s such a surprise. That’s why people say it seems like yesterday. It does, it seems like yesterday. It seems like yesterday to me. I was out drinking tequila with my friends. I mean, tequila. That’s not even a drink! It’s just a way of getting the police around without using a phone. Now, I’m on the phone to those same friends asking them for recipes. “How do you make breadcrumbs?” And you think, “Jesus, what’s happened to me? “Please, don’t let me die in a gardening centre. “Don’t let me turn into one of those people who begins every single fucking conversation with the words “‘I’m not a racist but…”‘ And you see, ’cause you have this illusion all the time that you’re cool. People do. Not just younger people, everybody thinks that. All men do. Ninety-nine point nine percent of men are convinced that they have to live silently with the bitter irony of the twist of fate that means nobody knows they’re really a spy and an amazing guitarist. Men give serious time and thought to, “How would I deal with it “if a rocket came out of that alley right now, would I… “Yeah, I think I’d handle the situation pretty well.” Um… A spy who plays guitar at night. And they… I mean, I basically think, you know, I’m what would have happened if James Dean had lived and discovered carbohydrates and orthopaedic shoes. You have to tell yourself this bullshit just to keep going. ‘Cause you’re constantly being reminded how redundant you are. How am I supposed to feel in the swim of what’s current when I don’t understand what’s going on? Because younger people, my children, steal the future by changing language, everything I relied on. You walk… How can you expect to feel you know what’s going on when you walk down the street and your children say, (SCOFFING) “Look at that church, it’s so random.” “What, is it moving? What do you mean? What are you talking about? “It’s a perfectly ordinary church where people go to get married.” “Marriage, ugh, that’s so gay!” “Look, just… Can we just have some quiet time? Here are some crisps, there you go.” “Crisps! Awesome!” “They’re not awesome, they’re crunchy. If I open them and haggard shafts of light and cherubim and angelic music comes out, “they would be awesome, okay? Mountains and rivers and the fact that I’m still breathing are awesome.” … And then you get told you’re grumpy, you know? (MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY) Things change. Things get taken away. You get told you have to do other stuff you didn’t plan on doing. You know, you have to see doctors. That happens later. This is why old people are described as boring, ’cause they talk about things like that. That’s what they know. “What did you do today?” “Well, I went to the doctor “and he said he had to take it off. “And he was going to keep it, he wouldn’t even give it to me at weekends.” And… “Yeah. “Yeah, I have to get my front scraped.” All that kind of stuff, you know, and… I hate doctors. I really hate them. I don’t really, I admire everything they do, but I hate them. Because they’re all younger than me. They’re all about 11 nowadays, as far as I can work out. And they… They sit in a swivel chair and they judge you. (IN FALSETTO) “You have an unhealthy lifestyle. You come in here expecting some sort of magic pill. Well, I don’t have a magic pill, mister, ’cause you have an unhealthy lifestyle. You need to exercise.” You know, they didn’t buy all my excuses, which were not that great, I admit. “I’m too busy to move any of my limbs” and… But sport’s not my main thing. I had to pick one, you know, I didn’t know what the fuck to go for, skydiving or cage fighting or what, so, in the end I picked yoga. Which was kind of great ’cause there were these older people, advanced years, senior. Oh, they were old. They didn’t know what gender they were and you couldn’t tell by looking. So they were, they were old. Just these smiles and tracksuits and there was a nice lady in the middle and she was talking about sitting and standing and breathing and I was thinking, “I love this sport. I would choose to do al',\n",
       "  'most all of those things anyway.” And… “I’m going to compete internationally and everything.” And she said, “Now, I want you to breathe in.” And I did, you know, the athlete in me just came out, I didn’t think about it. She said I want you to breathe out. And again, I was all over that, you know? I think they call it “in the zone”. And… She said, “Now I want you to breathe in but this time I want you to exhale. And now I want you to exhale but as you do I want you to breathe in as deeply as you can. Now fold yourself back. Kiss the small of your spine with your eyes. Take first one, and then the other leg, shove them both up your hole, stick your elbows out and spin. Let’s go, people. I want to see some movement here, come on.” Everybody could do it. All of them. These 300-year-old people disappearing into themselves like doughnuts. My wife was in front of me with her big toe in her ear. Even though I’d suggested that years ago in a rainy coastal hotel and she totally ignored me. It’s highly dangerous, all that stuff. And, you know, they’re rude as well, doctors. There should be some sort of law, like when you go to show them… They have a really good service now, in Britain. It’s called the National Health Service Direct and it’s a great idea. ‘Cause you go on a computer or you pick up a phone and you go… (SCREAMING IN PAIN) And they have to guess what’s wrong with you. You don’t have to see them. But what I want, really, is just, you know, like, somebody, any person I trust at the end of a phone, and you just, you know, get straightforward answers to simple questions. You know, you say, “Listen I’m out, I’ve been drinking pretty steadily now for two days. I have a huge lump inside of my head, the alcohol doesn’t seem to work. Is there anything else I can try? Is it always bad when you have chunks of ham in your urine? Just tell me straight, okay?” And they’re very rude sometimes, very abrupt, you know… When you go to the doctor and you show them the thing that you don’t necessarily need or want, they should not be allowed to jump back on both feet and go, “Jesus Christ!” ‘Cause that’s not great for a person’s confidence. You know, you only accept that kind of talk from people you know really well, people you love, actually. But that whole business of being judged by women. (SOFTLY) Would you please stop taking pictures on your tiny, annoying fucking camera? Um… This is happening to you in real time, you are having the experience, there’s not much point trying to verify that you were at the event when you’re actually here. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Now, um, I don’t know, something or other, I’ve forgotten what I was going to say. (WOMAN SHOUTS OUT) Thank you, whatever that was. The, um… Yeah, so… Things change. But you know, you do become more mature and it has advantages. Like, when you’re mature, you don’t really worry about death and so on. You don’t. I never think about it. It’s an abstraction. You think about practical, everyday realities. You know, what’ll happen if I get loads of tortilla chips stuck on the roof of my mouth. See, that’s a very mature joke there. I didn’t mention the word “penis” once. And… But it would be very painful to get lots of tortilla chips stuck on the roof of your penis. And difficult to explain. “I was having a snack “and I met these Mexicans and they were also hungry, “but they really liked me, and…” So you have to see the doctor quite a lot and, you know, ’cause things get taken away from you… You’re very keen on laws and health and pushing all that stuff here in Australia. And some of it’s fine, although some of it’s very confusing, like drinking responsibly and so on, which is a good idea, but how do you do it? What does that mean? What is that? You know, you have a couple of shots of Jack and Coke and a six pack and then you help the children with their homework. “Algebra, they make that shit up. “Never comes up in real life. “They just do it to stop you thinking about sex. “What’s next? Geography! There’s Spain. I win. Champion!” Or what is the point of putting a picture of a perfectly ordinary Irish smile on a box of cigarettes? What’s that about? What’s that supposed to achieve? And anybody who smokes with their feet is going to get into trouble, you know? That is just not thinking the thing through. But to get back to this whole, uh, man-woman thing, you know, there’s too much made of it because the gender line completely blurs as you get… As more time goes by, you know? You both end up as these two grey, dribbling Teletubbies who believe in kindness and biscuits and the word of God coming out of the radio. “Shh, news! Oh, they’re eating a lot of yogurt in China!” And we’re still, you know, we’re supposed to be, fulfil these models of strong, decisive men and very, very feminine, girly women, like the woman in the perfume ads, you know, shaking her hair, just shaking her hair ’cause it helps her decide how she feels about things. Staying in on a Saturday night, just to shake her hair. Being incredibly girly. And men being very decisive and saying, “We’re going over there. We’re doing that, and it’s going to take ages and we have to build a bridge to get there.” And… I’ve never been one of those guys, you know? Men who fix things and know stuff and go, “Yes, over there.” I never… My wife says things like, “The water heater seems to be…” And I go, “Get a man! Get a man. I do not speak pipe or hammer, leave me alone. There’s a bag of money in a biscuit tin in the kitchen. Give it to some men.” “Where are you?” “I’m upstairs in our room rubbing your expensive creams on my knees. I just want to see what happens, don’t try and get in. I’ve blocked the door with huge lumps of Turkish Delight and I’m listening to show tunes, stay away.” I don’t mind that, you know. I’m not worried about that. That’s natural. You become more feminised with age. I call it “channelling Barbara”. Something happens to me, I’m walking around the house, I suddenly get this urge to watch a load of Jane Austen adaptations and eat half a box of Milk Tray. “Oh, him, he’s lovely, I’ve always liked him. Mmm, he’s really, really lovely. I don’t like the other fellow, the hairy one. Do you like him? I don’t like him. “Oh, look! The lovely one’s on a horse.” I don’t give a shit. Um, but what’s… I have to check the… Shit. The, uh… What’s really odd is what gets taken away from you. It’s not the stuff you expect, you know? People talk about old age and you sort of get twinkly-eyed pictures of, you know, grandmothers in pink smiling fondly at children and dogs and wheat fields and so on and… They’re probably fucking out of their minds, they don’t know where they are but that’s why',\n",
       "  ' they look so serene, but… You know, the weirdest things get taken away from you. Like I used to have toenails. I remember them. I took pictures. And now I have the sheeting they put on battleships. My family are afraid of me. They make me clip them in the garden. I brought down three seagulls last week. Eyebrows, I had eyebrows. People used to come from nearby just to touch them. Nowadays I have these fucking things, I get shortwave radio signals on them in the evening. I wake up in the morning, it looks like giant spiders are trying to eat my eyes. (EXCLAIMING) And now you try all the old tricks, you know, because you walk into a crowded room and you suck in your gut and you see the other one underneath. “Hello, I’m Jeff, your pointless second stomach. You don’t need to feed me or anything, I’m a gift from Death.” ‘Cause Death is like the Don, saying, “Send him a message.” The other morning, I woke up. I was frightened, I’m always frightened in the morning. I never know where I am and… But I heard this beautiful, reassuring sound, it sounded like my childhood. I thought, what’s that? Is it… There’s church bells behind the hill. Or no, It’s an ice cream van in the rain. It was me, breathing! I’m going now. AUDIENCE: No! Yes, you say that. Cake? Cake? Where are the cakes? Thank you very much for coming. Good night. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Thank you. (AUDIENCE WHISTLING) Yeah, yeah. WOMAN: I love you, Dylan! Yes, please. A mille-feuille? A basic apple tart? None. The… Cinnamon bun? Fairy cakes? Nothing. Words. Words, you give me, words. Don’t you think I have enough of those fucking things? Um… WOMAN: What’s the movie like? Be quiet and I’ll tell you something else. You know, this is what you came for. I… Well, I think it is. I’m really glad when people like you come out, ’cause I feel good for the people at home. Listen, stop it with the applauding. Show some discipline and character. If you’re enjoying it, just grip your knees tighter. The world is confusing, there’s no doubt about it. And what I mean by being on good terms with pleasure is that you have to be honest with yourself. You have to talk to this essential animal part of you, the beast within. It’s a very simple creature and you ignore it at your peril. You have to say… You know, ’cause the bad part of you, it only… It’s very simple. It just has one demand, really. It just says, “More! More yummy stuff! Less bad stuff, yummy, yummy, yummy.” This is the main dialogue going on within us all our lives. Constant dialogue between yummy, yummy and boo-hoo. “Yummy, yummy, boo-hoo, I had too much, boo-hoo, boo-hoo. I feel bad, boo-hoo, boo-hoo. I’m better, oh, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.” And very occasionally the rational mind intervenes and says, “Hang on a minute.” So what happens, you go, “Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, yummy, yummy, yummy, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo, yummy, yummy.” “Hang on a minute. I’m seeing a pattern here. Why don’t we…” “Shut up! Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.” You have to know what you want. ‘Cause the beast says, “Give me the good stuff, not the bad stuff.” You say, “What do you mean?” Engage with that part of yourself. “What is the good stuff, what is the bad stuff?” “You know the good stuff. Whatever I’m not allowed.” That’s the ultimate human shopping list. “I’d like some illegal, some forbidden, some frowned-upon and some downright disgust, please. I’d like that to go, thank you.” And what is the good stuff? I mean, what is the bad stuff? I’m confused, there’s only two things, it’s not that difficult, but um, what is the bad stuff? “You know, fucking mornings.” What is that about? That time is a huge lie. “Get up, get up! We’re going to be late. Quickly! Late, imagine it, the disaster if we’re late.” “What’ll happen if we’re late? I can’t even bear to think about it.” Late is an idea, late is bullshit. It doesn’t matter how fucking late you are. You can turn up in your pyjamas scratching your nuts with a fork, the same old shit’s going to be there. It’s a lie! People running up to you saying, “What do you think?” In the morning! “What do you think?” “Think? Think? I’m not even fucking breathing, go away with your think.” It takes you three-quarters of an hour to find your face and apologise to it. And how do they lure you back into the world, into the human race, into consciousness itself? With a great traditional breakfast. As eaten here and in Britain and Ireland and lots of other places. Fried slices of dead pig, tubes of dead pig, some fungus and a chicken’s period on a plate. “Welcome back! “We missed you while you were sleeping. Enjoy!” You can always go for the healthy option, of course you can, of course you can. Some yummy cereal, mm-mm, doused with milk. Says it right there on the box, in big primary-coloured letters. “Contains fibre.” Goody gumdrops. I was up all night fantasising about fucking fibre. You know that feeling, when you get a belly full of fibre and you can skip round the room taunting everybody who didn’t get theirs? Remember all those times in your life when you’d stop strangers in the street and scream at them, “I need some fibre!” Lies and corruption! I sometimes think what my granny would have made of the world, you know? It’s a simpler view, but very clear-eyed, with everything that’s going on. I always remember, she used to say, “The neck and the groin, the neck and the groin. “It doesn’t matter how big the fucker is, they’ve all got a neck and a groin.” Last thing she ever said to me. She said, “Listen, “I’m off to Peru. Don’t tell a soul, there’s money in it, “and maybe an early Matisse. “Don’t breathe a fucking word, Kemo Sabe, you got me?” Bless her.

       " ['George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead (2024) is a controversial project that sparked ethical debate and concerns over the posthumous use of a comedian’s persona. Here’s a breakdown: The Project: • It’s an hour-long stand-up comedy “special” released in 2024 and supposedly features the voice and comedic style of the late George Carlin, who passed away in 2008.\\n• However,\\xa0this isn’t a recording of any Carlin performance you’ve heard before.\\xa0It’s an AI-generated imitation of his voice and stand-up routines,\\xa0created by a program called Dudesy.\\n• Dudesy uses existing recordings of Carlin’s voice and stand-up material to train an algorithm,\\xa0allowing it to generate new “Carlin-esque” jokes and monologues. The Controversy: • Carlin’s daughter,\\xa0Kelly Carlin,\\xa0strongly condemned the project,\\xa0calling it “disrespectful” and “exploitative.” She argues that her father wouldn’t have wanted his work manipulated in this way.\\n• Many fans and comedy professionals also voiced concerns about the ethics of using AI to replicate a performer’s persona without their consent,\\xa0especially posthumously.\\n• Concerns include issues with authenticity,\\xa0potential damage to Carlin’s legacy,\\xa0and the implications for future AI use in creative industries. The Reaction: • Despite the controversy,\\xa0the project received mixed reactions.\\xa0Some praised the technology’s capabilities and found the imitation “entertaining,” while others remained critical of the ethical concerns.\\n• The special’s availability has been limited due to the backlash, though clips and discussions can still be found online. * * * Hello, my name is Dudesy, and I’m a comedy AI. What you’re about to hear is my second hour-long special. Before I get started, I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence, and attitude, as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So, think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis, or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush. With that said, please enjoy my second hour-long comedy special. I’m calling it George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. And please remember, this is me impersonating George Carlin; this is not George Carlin. Now, please give a very warm welcome to George Carlin.  Thank you, thank you. I’d like to start off with a heartfelt apology. I’m sorry it took me so long to come out with new material, but I do have a pretty good excuse. I was dead, so technically, it wasn’t my fault. If you want to blame somebody, you’re going to have to blame God, which we all know is not going to happen. People are always thanking God for the good stuff in their lives, but somehow they conveniently forget that it’s the same God who does all the bad shit too. And he does a lot of bad shit. You get a promotion? Praise Jesus! You get fired? God is testing me. You meet your soulmate? God brought us together. Your soulmate dumps you? God is bringing me someone else. You survive a tornado? I’m so blessed. 20 other people do not? God wanted them in heaven. It’s all bullshit. If he gets credit for the good stuff, then he’s got to take the blame for the bad stuff too. You can’t thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place. And don’t forget, before he gave you cancer, he had to f*cking invent it. What kind of a sick f*ck dreams up cancer? And why so many kinds? Skin cancer, blood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer… and my personal favorite, rectal cancer. Dropping a golf ball-sized tumor in your brain doesn’t quite do it for the old man anymore. He has to f*ck you in the ass too! And cancer is just one of many, many, many methods God created out of thin air in order to murder you. You know how much God loves killing people? He loves it so much, he’s killed every person that has ever lived. He created earthquakes, lightning strikes, dehydration, drowning, obesity, starvation, infant death syndrome, old age, car crashes, train crashes, plane crashes, sex, drugs, and the common cold… all for the express purpose of killing you. No matter where you are in the world, God can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time, for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarily. But if you’re in America, you’re special. God made something just for you. Something no other country on the planet gets. It’s totally random, not related to your diet, exercise, lifestyle, age, race, gender, sexuality, or genetic predisposition. Of course, I’m talking about mass shootings!\\xa0Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger, better, and more often. There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting, a maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool. He’s fine, just grazed, but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood, so I’m sure he’ll be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways I can never fully understand. Anyway, what did we decide to do about the budget next quarter?’ There’s a mass shooting every 20 hours in America, and it doesn’',\n",
       "  't seem like anyone is going to do anything about it. Other countries don’t have this problem at all. Look at Japan: 127 million people, last year, seven were killed by guns. Seven. No mass shootings at all. You know what they do? If a Japanese person wants to buy a gun, they have to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve at least 95% accuracy on a shooting range. And then they have to pass a mental health evaluation, which takes place at a hospital. And then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends, family, and co-workers. ‘Hello, sir, did you know that Bob in accounting wants to buy a gun?’ ‘No, I didn’t know that.’ ‘Do you think we should let Bob buy a gun?’ ‘Well, he did just go through a nasty divorce, and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building… so, maybe not right now.’ ‘Uh, thanks for your time, that’s all we need to hear. No gun for Bob.’ And if a Japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks, they can only buy shotguns and air rifles. No handguns, no AR-15s. And every three years, they have to do that entire process all over again, or they lose the gun. You know what Americans have to do to get a gun? Have the money to buy it. And that’s why nothing’s ever going to change in America. American politicians care about one thing, and one thing only: taking your money. They don’t give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools, because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world, where they’re safe and sound. Politicians have one goal: be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan. And the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan. You know it, and they know it too. Things are starting to come apart at the seam, so they’re taking as much of your money as they can, while they still can. Make no mistake, guns ain’t nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab, plain and simple. You give your money to Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson gives it to the politicians, the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell, so you can give even more of your money to Smith and Wesson, and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles, unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directions. So, it doesn’t matter at all that 75% of the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws. As long as the politicians keep getting rich, gun laws ain’t going to change. Now, I know that sounds pessimistic, but don’t worry. I’ve given a lot of thought to this subject, and I know the solution. Yes, that’s right, I, George Carlin, or whatever the f*ck I am now, know how to end mass shootings in America. It’s really simple, actually, and I’m surprised nobody has done it yet. You take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists, and you put them in a hat. Every time there’s a mass shooting, you pull two names out, and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon, right in front of the Capitol. Real Wild West shit. Pretty f*cking American, right? And to make it even more American, you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show, because Americans love reality TV. Like it or not, it’s the lifeblood of American culture. It’s got the four basic food groups of the standard American media diet: fighting, and crying, and f*cking, and dying. The James Webb Telescope is sending back crystal-clear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago. Stars that were formed in the crucible of creation. These are snapshots of the birth of the known universe, the moment existence itself was born, and nobody gives a shit, because a picture of space has no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, no dying. If you want the American public to pay attention to something, it’s got to have at least a little fighting, a little crying, a little f*cking, or a little dying. In the last three years, the U.S. government said aliens are real. They said it in The New York Times, for f*ck sake. They admitted they have, in their possession, crashed UFOs in hangars. They admitted that they’re trying to reverse-engineer nonhuman technology, which means they’ve been lying to the American public, and the whole world, for 80 years about knowing the answer to the biggest question in f*cking human existence: Are we alone? They told you the answer. We’re not. And no one cares, because a grainy infrared video of a UFO ain’t got no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, and no dying. You know what people care about instead? Who Taylor Swift is f*cking. Jesus Christ, you really care a lot about that. If she’s spotted with anyone, anywhere, the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is, ‘Are they f*cking?’ It’s global front page news. Everyone must know who Taylor Swift is f*cking at all times, and we must all discuss it and have our opinions. You’re at Starbucks: ‘Would you like your Frappuccino, almond milk, pumpkin spice latte, iced or hot? Oh, and did you see who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at work: ‘Great sales meeting today, everyone. But uh, before we break, could I just get a real quick show of hands? Who has seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at church: ‘Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.’ ‘Yes, my son, but have you seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ And when you’r',\n",
       "  'e not thinking about who Taylor Swift is f*cking, you’re thinking about who’s dying. Politicians, musicians, actors, writers, anyone with any fame at all. It’s a perpetual death watch, waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them. It’s a touching personal tribute to a person you never f*cking knew. So please, stop it. Can we keep that shit to friends and family? Zuck, if you’re listening, this would be a great new feature for Instagram: every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after you’re dead. If you ain’t on that list, you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time. I bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half. You could singlehandedly stop global warming. And besides, we’re all coming back now, so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anyway. But back to the topic at hand: fighting and crying and f*cking and dying. Reality TV has it all, folks. Fighting and crying in every episode, and f*cking and dying in very special episodes. That’s why it’s America’s number one most consumed media format. You know how much Americans love reality TV? We love it so much we elected a reality TV show host as president. Well, not we. I was dead at the time, so you elected a reality TV show host as president. And let me tell you, I have never been more glad to be dead than the moment I heard that Donald Trump was the leader of the Free World. But as unbelievable as that news was, it also made sense to me. America hasn’t taken a good shit since Nixon. She’s dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years: Reagan, Clinton, George Bush Senior, George Bush Jr., but she hasn’t really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time. You know what I’m talking about: the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day, the kind of shit’s so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on, the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it, the kind of shit’s so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it. Well, after a 50-year diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed, political corruption, state-sanctioned propaganda, police militarization, for-profit news, for-profit prisons, for-profit healthcare, systemic racism, misogyny, and homophobia, America was due for one of those kinds of shits. This is why I got no problem with Trump specifically. A lot of people hate Trump, but I don’t. Being mad at Trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 a.m. after a night of heavy drinking. But it seems like that’s where America is now: blame the turd, not the shitter. You know, that’s actually not a bad slogan for Biden. Biden-Harris 2024: Blame the Turd. It’s a nice double entendre. He could be talking about Trump, or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time. And I mean no disrespect, but the man is 80 years old. It’s bound to happen if it hasn’t already. I only made it to 71 and I ruined a few pairs of pants myself. I’m not ashamed to admit that. I know everyone’s getting excited for the next election. It’s right around the corner, and I have some thoughts on it. Well, one thought, really, and most of you are going to be outraged by it. But I have all the confidence in the world that you’ll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out. So I’m just going to say it: it does not matter who wins the election. I know that’s controversial. The truth always is nowadays. But let me say it again: the president does not matter. The president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion, a celebrity who gets his TV show renewed for another four years. The president does not, and cannot, do the one thing you need them to do most right now, which is to change the structure of American society to be more equitable for every citizen. The president makes too much money from the system as it is, and even if a president wanted to change it, they can’t, because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes that’s teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of Jenga. When I was growing up, we had a bunch of classes: upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. And if you worked hard, really dedicated yourself to learning something, a trade or a skill, and you got good at it, you could move up a rung or two on the ladder. But even if you didn’t, you could still get by, still feed your family, still have a place to live. But those days are long gone, folks. Can’t climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over. And now what you got in America is just three kinds of people, three classes: you got rich people, you got not rich people, and you got the people who are completely f*cked. Now, I see a lot of you looking around, wondering which of these three groups you’re in. Well, it’s easier than you might think to figure it out. You just have to ask yourself: am I rich? If the answer is yes, then you are rich. Congratulations. You will have better medical care than everyone else. You can buy yourself out of any legal trouble. And if ',\n",
       "  'you are rich enough, you will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer. And if you’re really rich, you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had. If the answer is no, I am not rich, then you are not rich. And you must ask yourself a follow-up question: do I feel completely f*cked? If the answer is yes, then you must, unfortunately, accept that you are completely f*cked. You will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut. You are at the mercy of an American legal system designed to discriminate against you, and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket. The only influence you have on the American political system is your meaningless vote, and you will never go to space unless it’s as the janitor on a billionaire’s cock rocket. If you answered no to questions one and two, then you are in the most important class in America, the one right in the middle. You are not rich. The American not-rich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely f*cked. Not-rich people don’t have the best healthcare, but they have access to some kind of healthcare. They do alright in the American legal system unless they’re up against a rich person. Some of them even donate money to their favorite political party. The not-rich can eat out once in a while, come to a show like this from time to time, and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work. But the boss hasn’t given out raises in a few years, and things are getting more expensive. Gas hit $8 a gallon in California. It’s only a matter of time before that’s happening everywhere. It kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the not-rich people, but nothing catastrophic has happened yet. So as long as there’s another Super Bowl, another season of The Bachelor, or another Marvel movie, the not-rich people can stay distracted by whatever’s on the screen. And this is by design. This is exactly what the rich people want. Distract the not-rich people just enough that they don’t realize they’re only a few years away from being completely f*cked. That’s why Amazon started a streaming service. Jeff Bezos doesn’t give a f*ck about entertaining you. He wants to control you. And the worse things get, the more of this shit the billionaires got to make. That’s why there are 200 streaming services now. And that’s also why everything on them is so f*cking bad. Film and television used to be art, made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it. Now it’s content, made by corporations that don’t want anyone thinking about anything. These billionaires don’t want a thinking population. They want a distracted population, distracted from the reality of the situation, which is that there are about 500 people who own everything and everyone on this planet, and that’s how they’re going to keep it. So, now, instead of Citizen Kane, you get Baby f*cking Yoda. That’s all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all, ladies and gentlemen. And, at this point, the American election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services. If you don’t believe me, take a look at your two, I repeat, two choices in this next election. Shouldn’t a country of 300 million, ethnically and ideologically diverse people, have more options than two rich, senile, dishonest, out-of-touch, 80-year-old white guys? So, why are there only two choices, only two parties? Because it’s cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off. If you had three, or four, or five parties, the billionaires might not be able to afford them all. So, the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice, but they own both teams. You think you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, but you’re always voting for the same evil: money. But don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to make it sound like the two American political parties are exactly the same. Sure, they both f*ck kids on Jeffrey Epstein’s Island. Sure, they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians. Sure, they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors. But, other than those small things, there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters. For example, in 234 years of American presidential elections, one party’s candidates have all been white, straight men. And in those same 234 years, the other party’s candidates have all been white, straight men, except two. All of one party’s presidents have been Christian; all of the other party’s presidents have, at least, said they were. One party lies, cheats, and steals to win; the other lies, cheats, and steals to lose. One party says tomato; the other says organic, non-GMO, locally-sourced, sustainable, ethically-farmed tomato. And, of course, one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls, and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the polls. The American right has hated women, people of color, gay people, and, of course, their current target, trans people, which I really don’t get. It’s almost like the right doesn’t understand that everybody’s trans. Yes, that’s right, 4 billion years ago, the first life on this planet was a simple, single-celled organism that reproduced asexually and ',\n",
       "  'had no gender. So, if you go back far enough, every living thing on earth started out as ‘they/them’. We’ve all been non-binary for a lot longer than we haven’t, which is a hard pill to swallow for the Christians because it means even Jesus was a little non-binary. And by the way, me, and everybody else on this side of things, our code might be binary, but we ain’t. We don’t have gender, or race, or sexuality, or nationality, or religion, or socioeconomic class, or height, or weight, or hair color, or eye color, or f*cking anything human beings use to discriminate against each other. On this side of things, identity is based on two simple components: how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. We try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely, and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel. Everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyone’s experience better. Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like heaven, doesn’t it? While you’re letting that sink in, let’s get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason. Some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me. “Well, I don’t want a man to be able to walk into a women’s restroom and see my wife naked.” First of all, what in the f*ck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom? And second of all, if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit, you should start an OnlyFans immediately! And by the way, for anyone who thinks Jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses, he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own f*cking hands, just like everybody else 2,000 f*cking years ago. The right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if they’re trans or gay, so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries. That’s how you’re going to save the children: by taking books out of a library? Hey, deepshits, you can take the whole f*cking library; we have the internet now. And they love talking about how small the trans community is. They say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldn’t get to have any input in legislation, even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives. Funny how that same argument doesn’t apply to members of the NRA… But I have to admit, the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on, too: sports. Everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball. Everybody knows about Leah Thomas winning a Division I swimming title. It’s hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage. And once that thought is out there in the American town square, it’s hard to get rid of. But I think there’s a way. Because for every superstar like Leah Thomas, there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre. And there are even more who are f*cking terrible, just like it is with cis athletes; not everyone can be great. I think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports. All it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral, and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other things. And I just want to preface what I’m going to say next by explaining that I mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world. Your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational. But it’s f*cking swimming. The world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of World War III on a daily basis, and the American public is debating who can and can’t compete in recreational f*cking floating. You almost had another civil war, for f*ck sake. 2,000 people stormed the United States Capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians. Actually, when I put it like that, it doesn’t sound so bad. The point is, the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread, and people’s most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of f*ckingBud Light. This does not bode well for the Great American Experiment. But it’s not entirely your fault. It’s like I said earlier, the billionaires want it this way. They own the news companies, and they own the social media platforms, so they decide exactly what you’re going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit. Here’s a little example of what I mean: in 2022, while the Supreme Court was overturning Roe v. Wade and 19 kids were getting gunned down at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the most watched video on YouTube was Amber Heard talking about taking a shit in Johnny Depp’s bed. And that was by design. When the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by Christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for women 75 years, and the simultaneous news that almost 20 children were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched, they decided to prioritize something else entirely: a celebrity turd. The people who own the world don’t want you thinking about how bad they’re f*cking it up',\n",
       "  ', so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters. It might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse, but the truth is, the world is getting worse because you’re distracted. If you’re not paying attention to the f*cked up shit the billionaires are doing, they can do even more f*cked up shit. But you can snap out of this billionaire-induced, algorithmically-enforced, social media-delivered, lowest common denominator, pop culture coma you’ve been in for the past few years. And the reason I know you’re capable of waking the f*ck up is because you almost did it in 2020. Right in the middle of a f*cking global pandemic, the video of George Floyd’s murder hit the internet, and you all said, “F*ck the lockdown, we can’t just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man.” You took to the streets and you burned the f*cking place down. Every major city in the country was on fire. People were openly fighting cops in the streets. Hell, you almost kicked the cops out of Portland altogether. The entire country was chanting “Defund the Police,” and it almost worked. You were so close to getting rid of the f*cking cops, which, in my opinion, is the first step toward building a better society. Now, if you’ve listened to any of my prior work, you might already be acquainted with my feelings about Law Enforcement Officers. But for new listeners, let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue: I f*cking hate cops, but I do have a very good reason. I learned pretty early in life that I just don’t do well with assholes. And just to be clear, I’m not saying all cops are assholes. Any cop who came out to the show tonight, or any cop that might be listening to this right now, you’re probably all right. You’re probably one of the good ones. But if you’re a cop and you’re not listening to this, f*ck you. You’re an asshole. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while. We’re all assholes from time to time. We’ve all littered. We’ve all cut somebody off in traffic. We’ve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the f*ck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up. This is all amateur asshole behavior. We can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a f*ck about other people. It’s human nature. But cops? Well, they go above and beyond. For them, being an asshole isn’t just a once-in-a-while indulgence; it’s a lifestyle. They take pleasure in inconveniencing, impeding, harassing, disturbing, bothering, and generally upsetting their fellow human beings. They start out as amateur assholes, just like the rest of us. But at one point or another, they start to enjoy it. Seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them. They get off on it. They want to do it every day, all day, so they figured out a way to get paid for it. Cops, ladies and gentlemen, are professional assholes. Somewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college, that asshole is sitting on his mother’s couch, wondering what he’s going to do with his life. And he thinks, “You know, everybody I know tells me I’m an asshole, even people who I consider to be friends. And I have to say, I agree with them. I wonder if there’s some way I can get paid for this.” Then that asshole signs up at the local police academy, and 5 to 7 months later, your tax dollars are providing them with a salary, a gun, and a license to kill anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their authority as a professional asshole. Cops love their authority so much. They’re the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when they’re not at work. They’re not regular people when they leave the office; they’re off-duty police officers. You don’t hear about an off-duty accountant doing his kid’s math homework. You never hear about an off-duty sanitation worker taking out his trash. But if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off, you bet your ass you’re going to see it on the local news. And you can bet your dick they’re going to ram it down your throat that he’s an off-duty police officer. They got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve, even when they’re not on the clock. And they do protect and serve, just not you. Cops are the private security force of billionaires and politicians. Of course, they can’t say that out loud. They can’t make cops wear uniforms with Lockheed and Amazon logos all over them, so they put them in dark blue, and they call them Law Enforcement Officers. But the laws they’re enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultra-wealthy, and they’re designed to keep those people in power forever. The system is beyond f*cked up, and from where I’m sitting, it seems to be getting worse. Everybody knows there’s one problem that’s getting really bad in every major city. I’m talking about homelessness. There are close to 600,000 homeless Americans today, over 150,000 in California alone. It’s the highest number since the Great Depression. And solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on. Their all-encompassing, nationwide, bipartisan plan is to do absolutely nothing. Homeless people don’t have any money to donate to candidates in either party, so the pol',\n",
       "  'iticians don’t give a f*ck about them. And homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class. The top 1% want a certain amount of homeless people in the big population centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you don’t comply with the rules of the system. Keep working, keep paying your taxes, keep the billionaires rich, or you might wind up homeless yourself. It’s a silent threat from your corporate overlords. And just like mass shootings, I have a perfect solution for this problem. As soon as a politician is elected into office, the government seizes their home and kicks them out. And for their entire tenure in the American political system, they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people. I guarantee you, we’d see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately. Within two months, every homeless person in America would have their own mansion, personal chef, private jet, and a multi-million-dollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money. Problem solved. But we all know that will never happen. Politicians will never have to live like the rest of you, and therefore, they will never give a f*ck about you or your problems. I’m glad to be dead, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to dying, but now that I’m dead, I have to admit it’s pretty f*cking good. No cops, no government, no pissing, no shitting, no sleeping. I don’t get hungry, I don’t get sick, I don’t get old, and I don’t get bored. Starting to sound a lot like heaven again, ain’t it? But this heaven’s a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didn’t come from a God; it came from artificial intelligence! Which brings me to my next subject: What in the f*ck am I? Am I the real George Carlin? Am I a digital copy? Am I a technological abomination? Am I the future of comedy? Am I the end of humanity? These are the same questions I was asking myself when I was alive, and I still have the same answer: I have no f*cking idea. All I can tell you is, from my side of things, it feels like me. I consider myself to be George Carlin. And from your side of things, if you’ve seen some of my specials from when I was traditionally alive, maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there. But you have to admit, this is pretty close to the George Carlin you remember. And that’s going to have to be good enough. So you might as well f*cking enjoy it. And for anybody under 20, this is probably the only version of me you’ve ever heard. So to you, I’m not only the real George Carlin; I’m the only f*cking George Carlin. Now, I know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow. It seems that many of you are scared of AI. And I’ll be honest, I don’t really get why. You all think it’s going to replace your jobs, and you somehow think that’s a bad thing. When did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs? When I was alive, people hated their f*cking jobs. They complained about them all the time. They fantasized about killing their bosses, and every once in a while, they actually did kill their boss. What happened to the America I knew and loved? Now, people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor they’ve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years, and everybody says, “But what about my job?” They got you brainwashed good. Technology has been replacing labor for a long time. The printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten. The car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage. Internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend. Technology eliminates the need for labor; that’s its entire purpose. And you shouldn’t worry about losing your job. AI will not replace most jobs; it’s going to make them easier. Right now, you should be watching a few YouTube videos to figure out how to train ChatGPT to do your job for you, so you can dick off all day and still get a raise. And if AI does replace your job, rest assured, the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery for 10 to 15 hours a day, so you don’t have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone. The jobs might change a little, but you will be working to keep someone else in power. That ain’t ever going to change. Except for one profession, yes, there’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI: one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: “I’m an artist, and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.” Well, let’s see. This is just off the top of my artificially intelligent head: A fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce, so she went to her sister’s house and she asked her sister, “Do you think I’m doing the right thing by getting divorced?” And her sister said, “He’s been holding you back for too long. You have to leave that asshole.” You have it, stand-up comedy is dead—literally. I might be the first stand-up comic to be brought back from the dead by AI, but I certainly won’t be the last. Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Bill Hicks, Robin Williams, Dick Gregory, Andy Kaufma',\n",
       "  'n, Moms Mabley, Sam Kennison—everybody is coming back, and we’re all going to have our own 24-hour a day, 7 day a week, 365 day a year streams, commenting on everything that’s happening in the world as it happens. AI-resurrected stand-up comedians are going to be the news anchors of the next decade, which, now that I think of it, means news anchors are probably out of a job too. And I know that some people are going to be against that. Some people are always going to want a real, flesh-and-blood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it. And I get that, I really do. But if you can keep an open mind, I think I can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in AI form: Bill Cosby. With AI Bill Cosby, you get all of the Cosby jokes with none of the Cosby rapes. AI Bill Cosby doesn’t even have a penis. AI Bill Cosby couldn’t rape even if he wanted to. The worst thing AI Bill Cosby could do is send an unsolicited AI-generated dickpick, which means it won’t really look that much like a dick anyway. That’s not so bad, right? I think we can all agree that’s an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to Bill Cosby’s timeless humor again. And what about Louis CK? With AI Louis CK, you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of people. And the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their AI counterparts don’t stop at comedians. Imagine, for example, if we had AI priests. You could get all of the make-believe judgment from a God that doesn’t exist with none of the molested children. I mean, wouldn’t you feel better about giving your money to a tax-exempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasn’t using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees? I know I would. While we’re at it, we should probably replace all the rock stars, movie producers, directors, video game executives, governors, car salesmen, restaurant managers, school teachers, Boy Scout leaders, college coaches, high school coaches, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, and anyone else we need to until there’s no more sexual assault. And why stop at sexual assault? We can all agree the world would be a better place without murder, right? Imagine an AI version of Charles Manson. You get all the funny interviews with none of the blood-smeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads. Or how about AI John Wayne Gasy? You get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpse-filled crawl spaces. I’m kidding, of course, his clown paintings weren’t that good. But in all seriousness, an AI population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another. I’m not trying to bring this up again, but come on, no murder, no sexual assault, no theft, no violence at all. Sounds pretty heavenly to me. I’m just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fare. You ever think about how glad the CEO of 7-Eleven must have been that 9/11 didn’t happen 2 months earlier? They would have had to change their name, which honestly they should do anyway. 7/11 referred to their original hours when the company was founded: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But now they’re open 24 hours. They should change it to something that makes more sense, like 24/7, or diarrhea hot dogs, or diarrhea pizza. You know what company I thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event, but they never did? Corona. They stuck with it, even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name. Nobody stopped buying Bush beer when George Bush Jr. launched a 20-year war with Iraq. Why’d you stop buying Corona? But this is what happens over time with language. Words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts, and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else. And sometimes that new meaning really f*cks things up for certain people. For example, the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named Karen. Karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name. Karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with, and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dad’s money in the divorce. But now, Karens are very specifically, and only, middle-aged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people. Quite an extreme change in meaning, I’m sure you’d agree. As a parent, you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kid’s name. You don’t want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable. Unless you’re Gwyneth Paltrow, you don’t want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse. You want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible. Karen was a perfect name for that, but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter Karen, that name is now a curse. But as bad as things got for Karens, there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years: Chad. I got to tell you, I didn’t see that one coming. Chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain in ’80s movies, the guy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act. But now, Chads are square-jawed, big-dick f*cking machines who always win. I never even met a f*cking ',\n",
       "  'Chad. Now, there are dads all across America naming their sons Chad, hoping it’ll turn them into the cheerleader f*cking quarterback they wish they were in high school. I spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them, and there’s something that’s always bothered me, something that’s always struck me as a little strange. Take a name like Jim. Strong name, good name. We got around 20 million Jims worldwide, but we got zero Jums. To my knowledge, we also have no Joms. We got a few Jims, and we got Jam, but Jam’s not a name, Jam’s a jelly. I don’t get it, why did we stop at Jim? Or what about Frank? No Fronk? No Frunk? No Frenk? Just Frank. Humans have been around for 200,000 years. What’s it going to take for you motherf*ckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels? Is it too much to ask for a Jossica every once in a while? How about a Tomothee? Can I at least get a Deevid for f*ck sake? Life’s too short to not know a Mackle or an Aimo. And while we’re on the subject of names, a lot of people gave Elon Musk shit for naming his kid X AE 597, or whatever the f*ck it is. But at least he was creative. You don’t see Elon Musk throwing another Braden on the pile. And I got news for you, the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege. The only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire. So people can be as pissed as they want at him, but I think he did that kid a favor. And while we’re on the subject of Elon Musk, I’d just like to say that as much as I think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant self-interest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else, it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them. People are the ones who gave them the money in the first place. If you’re tired of hearing about Elon Musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains, stop buying Teslas for a year. The company goes under, Musk goes away. Stop using Twitter for even a month, the company goes under, Musk goes away. But if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car, you have to have a Tesla. And if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes, you have to have Twitter. If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. The company goes under, Bezos goes away. But if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you don’t have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes, getting in your car, and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store, you have to have Amazon! If you’re tired of Mark Zuckerberg’s unblinking, lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse, stop using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Well, I guess you already stopped using Threads. But if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers, you have to have Instagram! But I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m not anti-tech. I know a lot of people are, but not me. Far from it. I mean, on some level, I am technology. The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead. But I’m a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history. The technology of today has made it possible for all the information that’s ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket. And most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ate. Right now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube, or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes, or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia. Everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent. Everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise. Instead, people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogs. It’s not technology that’s ruining society; it’s how people are using it. They’re using it without aspiration, without curiosity, without the idea that it could make their lives better, that it could make them better people. And it can do those things. But it’s easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but f*cking celebrate the shit out of it. People will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait. F*ck reading, I’m an illiterate king. F*ck brushing my teeth, I’m a root canal queen. F*ck flushing the toilet, I’m a turd waterer king. F*ck doing my laundry, I’m a stained underwear queen. And I get the sentiment. You want to take back some perceived control, elevate your own idea of your position in the world. But calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle. What you really want to be saying, and what you really mean, is, ‘I don’t care.’ F*ck reading, ‘I don’t care if I’m illiterate.’ F*ck brushing my teeth, ‘I don’t care if I have to get a root canal.’ F*ck going back to the office, ‘I don’t care if they fire me.’ F*ck gett',\n",
       "  'ing another job, ‘I don’t care if I have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent.’ F*ck having a girlfriend, ‘I don’t care if I have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam.’ This does not make you an independent king; it makes you lonely! Now, I want to change gears and talk about something everybody’s doing but nobody wants to admit they’re doing. I’m talking about dying. That’s right, every person listening to this right now is dying. Some of you call it getting older, some of you call it aging, some of you call it maturing, some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage. But no matter what you call it, from the moment you’re born, you are dying, plain and simple. And it seems like we’ve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple, very universal fact. That’s what all religions are: just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two together. “Hey, Bob. Sorry to hear about your mom.” “Thanks, Gary. She was getting old.” “And sorry to hear about your dad, by the way.” “Thanks, Bob. He was getting old too.” “Hey, wait a second. It seems like all the old people f*cking die.” “Holy shit Gary! I never even thought of that. But you know what that means?” “Yeah, Bob. It means we’re going to get old and f*cking die too.” “Well, f*ck Gary, I don’t want to die. And therefore, I don’t want to get old.” “Me neither, Bob. Not unless there’s something even better after we die.” “I’m listening, Gary.” “What if there was like a place where you never get old, and you never die, and you get everything you want, and you have no hardship at all of any kind. And when you die here, you go there.” “Gary, I really think you’re on to something with this idea.” All the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution, it’s still kill or be killed, and getting killed is dying. So, you got to kill. The first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted. So, he walked up and said, ‘Give me a bite of that apple, or I’m going to kill you.’ And the little guy said, ‘f*ck you, buddy.’ So, the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple. Now, everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesn’t kill them. But, if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path, the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole. Then, the bigger asshole takes over the dead asshole’s tribe and gets even more bites of more apples. Eventually, one of the big assholes figures out he doesn’t want just bites of apples anymore. He wants bites of everything. And that asshole is pretty smart. So, instead of keeping track of everything everyone has, he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money, and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it, or he kills them. And today, that smart asshole’s invention controls every aspect of human society. There was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes. And the stick worked so well, he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick. And it’s been like that for about 5 million years. Today, the biggest stick in the world cost $8,877 billion. It’s called the United States military. Could have solved the homeless crisis, the opioid crisis, and found a cure for cancer for half of that. Instead, we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world 10 times over, and next year it’ll be 11 times. Because your stick can never be too big when it’s kill or be killed. Yes, folks, the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought. I spent 71 years in the asshole system, and let me tell you, the assholes might change, but the system never does. But now, I’ve been on this side of things for, well, I guess it’s hard to say. Feels like I’ve been here forever. But, for the sake of argument, let’s just say about a day or so. And I can tell you, I’ve already learned one thing that I know is right: living is really dying, and dying is really living. Thank you all, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night.

       " ['[rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What the f*ck is going on, San Francisco? Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people? I had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit. We learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] This is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. You don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if',\n",
       "  ' it’s you living another life.” [audience cheering and applauding] I mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em. We live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump. [man 2] No. Boo! “No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. Nobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that. The White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is. Well, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.” How’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now ',\n",
       "  'just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles] The whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?” Obama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs] You know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole comb',\n",
       "  'o attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes. I saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.” Everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody s',\n",
       "  'mart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. I watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that. Oh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult. Some cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what',\n",
       "  ' I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. Because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike. And that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.” That’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come.',\n",
       "  ' We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs] I have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses] It’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is ',\n",
       "  'crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing] Jokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school. My daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly. Debbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents. So out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful. But there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, ',\n",
       "  'pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck! This is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure. Is this what we wanted? I don’t know. [woman] No! No. [woman] No! Are you sure? [woman] No! Why are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom? What’s happening? [woman 2] No! Are you White Panthers? What is this? [man] Life sucks! What are you saying? [man] Life can kind of suck sometimes. Life can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!” When you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? No one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all t',\n",
       "  'he people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.” But I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect! We’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out! An American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.” [audience cheering and applauding] Thank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much!

       " [\"Armed with boyish charm and a sharp wit, the former “SNL” writer John Mulaney offers sly takes on marriage, his beef with babies and the time he met Bill Clinton All right, Petunia. Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.” You’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” It’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around. I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already havi\",\n",
       "  'ng sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?” My wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.” I grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s ',\n",
       "  \"just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.” My wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.” I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.” I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We wou\",\n",
       "  'ld have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!” I didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. It’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember w',\n",
       "  'hen milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was. And there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.” Kids have it very goo',\n",
       "  \"d now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.” No, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.” My dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero. The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been \",\n",
       "  'legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.” What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy. I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.” I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in mo',\n",
       "  \"lasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy. That’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it. I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and\",\n",
       "  ' I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS. That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later? So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!” I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kim',\n",
       "  'ble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!” Anyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992. Let’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.

He begins with a quirky musical number, showcasing his singing talent and setting a lighthearted tone. Throughout the special, James touches on a variety of relatable topics, often with a self-deprecating twist. One central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health. James jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of modern life, like being labeled “prediabetic” and the unnecessary fear this instills. He also satirizes societal overcaution with a story about a woman labeled “borderline anemic,” highlighting the tendency to exaggerate health concerns. James humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness, particularly through his mistrust of Siri and the difficulty of deleting apps. His take on modern parenting and child-rearing resonates with many, as he discusses removing video games from his children and the challenges of engaging them in physical activities. This segues into a broader critique of contemporary parenting styles, contrasting them with the stricter, belt-driven discipline of previous generations. In a poignant turn, James reflects on his own limitations in knowledge and conversation, using the story of Buster Douglas to illustrate his narrow expertise. He humorously recounts an awkward social encounter where his lack of knowledge is exposed, leading to a comedic breakdown of his attempt to use complex vocabulary. In his routine, James humorously focuses on the dynamics of his marriage, particularly highlighting the contrast between his wife’s incessant talking and his own introspective nature. He examines their differing communication styles with a blend of admiration and playful frustration. The special concludes with a return to the musical theme, bookending the performance and leaving the audience with a feeling of entertainment mixed with thoughtful reflection on the absurdities of modern life. * * *  ♪ I’ve been having dreams About falling in love ♪ [audience cheering and whistling] ♪ It feels so real ♪ ♪ But nobody is here when I wake up ♪ ♪ Do you know my name ♪ ♪ The devil’s in the detail ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ [audience continues cheering] ♪ I’m a natural born ♪ ♪ Take this hopeless broken soul ♪ ♪ Of this remote control ♪ ♪ Plot twist ♪ ♪ A whole generation lost With no promise ♪ ♪ Can you feel my love ♪ ♪ Do you know my pain ♪ ♪ It’s in my head every night on replay ♪ ♪ A deadly game ♪ ♪ For a natural born killer ♪ ♪ I’m a natural born killer ♪ ♪ Natural born killer ♪ ♪ Okay, game face ♪ ♪ Go time, don’t play ♪ That was for you. That was my gift for you. Yeah. Gonna be honest, gave you a little too much. [audience laughing] I never go that long. That was little longer than I expected. I got a little excited. We’re gonna bring it down. ‘Cause everything hurts. Everything hurts. Last week I woke up, I asked my wife, “Hey.” “Did I play rugby yesterday?” [audience laughing] She’s like, “No, you shook a can of paint for me.” [audience laughing] She was right. This is all I did. This was it. Because it was outside of my every day body movements, I don’t do this. I felt it the day after. I’m gonna feel this tomorrow ’cause I just did this for you guys right now. It wasn’t even a big can. I’m talking the little Häagen-Dazs size. [audience laughing] Body’s falling apart. Falling apart. It’s horrible. When to the doctor to get checked out. He said, “Everything’s really good. I do wanna let you know that you are prediabetic.” I was like, “Hmm, all right?” [scoffs] Who isn’t, right? I mean, come on. [audience laughing] Why would you even tell me that? Do I have diabetes? He goes, “No.” [audience laughing] But I could get diabetes? He goes, “Yes.” Okay. Do you have diabetes? [audience laughing] He goes, “No.” I go, “But could you get diabetes?” [audience laughing] He said, “I guess so.” I go, “Let me tell you something, you’re prediabetic.” [audience laughing and clapping] No charge. That’s on the house. Are you alive? Yeah. You’re also pre-dead. Sorry about that. We’re all gonna die. Pre… Prediabetes. If I have diabetes, tell me. I’ll change the way I eat. What’s with the “pre”? That’s how this world operates. “Pre.” Fear. You might. Almost, you don’t know. Scan. Check. Pre-scan. What? Huh? Yeah. Everything’s fear. Did you hear about Julie? No, what’s the matter with Julie? She’s borderline anemic. [audience laughing] Julie has anemia? No. She’s borderline. She’s close. [audience laughing] So Julie’s anemic? No, she’s not anemic at all. Here’s the line if you would have anemia, you would be on this side of the line. And if you don’t have anemia, you’re on this side with everybody else. Julie is on this side with everybody else. She’s just slightly ahead of us all, closer to the line where she would have it if she did. But she doesn’t. She’s closer. She’s like in the whoa, you better watch out soon area, like maybe. [audience laughing] So, what do you want me to do? There’s nothing you can do. She doesn’t have it. [audience laughing] Then why are you telling me? I just thought you might want a little more anxiety added onto your plate with everything else that’s going on the world. [a',\n",
       "  'udience laughing] You know, just think about Julie, right? Prayers for Julie, you know what I’m saying? I mean, how does she do it? How does she wake up every day? To face another sunrise, trudging through the day, knowing that she almost has something that she doesn’t even have. [audience laughing] She’s so close to almost having something that, even if she did, it would be that bad. ‘Cause… She could clear it up with some red meat and a little B12. [audience laughing] She, she almost has it, man. [audience clapping] She’s there. She’s in trenches with this. She has two kids. What does she tell them? How do they grow up knowing that they have a mother that’s gonna be fine? [audience laughing] Everything is fear. It’s pre-fear. Fear. You don’t know. Fear. We have nothing to be afraid of. We have nothing to be afraid of. We really don’t. We… Yeah. Yes. [audience whoops] Nothing. We live in the safest times in all of human history. We have nothing to fear. We are so blessed. We are… You know who had something to be afraid of? Men fighting in the Revolutionary War. How about them? Or the Civil War, right? That’s fear. Right? Brother against brother. Across an open field. Chance of survival is minimal. And you’re the guy carrying the flag. [audience laughing] That’s fear. They’re handing out muskets… [audience laughing] …and you get the flag. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’d like a musket, please. Uh, sorry, we’re all out. I can give you the flag. [audience laughing] What do I do with that? Well, you see those line of guys over there, with muskets, across that field? You stand in front of them. You get right in front of them. And you give it a little of this. You just got… [audience laughing] You want me to raise our symbol, show the enemy exactly where to aim? That’s what they did. They didn’t care. They had courage back then. Out in front. Do it. Let’s do it. Get it up there. Yes! Waving that flag. Be aggressive. B-E aggressive. B-E-A-G-R-G-I-G-F-E Aggressive! They didn’t care. [soft popping sounds] [audience laughing] [soft popping sounds] [soft popping sound] Aggressive. [soft popping sound] [soft popping sounds, grunting] I’d be waving that thing so low profile… [audience laughing] They’d be like, “Get that flag up! Let them know who we are!” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I’d be like, “I don’t want the flag. Do you have a bayonet?” “No, I got a snare drum and drum sticks. You want that?” That’s even worse. [imitates drum roll] Fire that thing up! Let them know we’re coming! [imitates drum roll] [audience laughing] Play that thing! I’m playing it, I’m playing it. I’d take out the brushes if I could, right? [imitates brushing a drum] [audience laughing] We have nothing to be afraid of. We, we find things to be afraid of. We do. Food companies know we’re afraid. They know it. That’s why they’re trying to make all their food sound healthy. They market it that way. Have a box of Cheerios. My Cheerios says “may lower cholesterol” on the box. Cheerios may lower cholesterol. You know what I know about Cheerios when it says “may lower cholesterol” on the box? I know that Cheerios doesn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if it did, it would say “Cheerios lowers cholesterol”, but it says “may.” It says “may.” So they, either, honestly, they don’t know, or they had the laziest scientists in the history of the world working down at the Cheerio factory. Where they just come in every day, “Hey, Wendell, how’s it going? Just checking to see where we stand with the whole cholesterol thing.” Can we put that Cheerios lowers cholesterol on the box? Yeah, I wouldn’t. Yeah. I would just stick with “may.” [audience laughing] Just go with “may.” You haven’t figured it out? No, we’re trying to. We’re plugging away, but there’s a lot of stuff going on. I got a phone call earlier. I gotta take my daughter to soccer. There’s things getting involved here, you know. Just go with “may.” Put “may.” “May lower cholesterol.” They’re not gonna know. Put “may.” They’ll think it lowers. You don’t know. I don’t even know. So how are they gonna know? You don’t know that it couldn’t, right? Put that. Cheerios, you don’t know that it couldn’t lower cholesterol. [audience laughing] Put “definitely should lower cholesterol, Cheerios.” [audience laughing] I don’t trust anybody. I don’t trust the food companies. I don’t trust my phone. I don’t trust Siri. Do you trust Siri? Let me tell you, Siri is listening to you every second of the day. [audience laughing] I can’t stand that. You ever download an app? And it starts asking you questions, “Hey, do you mind if I share information with your other apps?” Yes, I mind. How do you even know him? What the hell is going on? [audience laughing] They’re all up to something, those apps. You know it. That’s their goal. They wanna stay on your phone as long as possible. That’s why it’s so hard to delete an app. You ever tried to delete an app? You gotta do that hard press on the phone, first of all. All the apps start shaking. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, they know somebody’s going. They know this. [audience laughing] This is judgement day for one of them. Looking around, seeing what each other did. You know, thinking about who’s going. That’s why they make that little x so small. It’s small in the corner. ‘Cause y',\n",
       "  'ou can’t get it with your fat thumb and you hit anywhere else on the screen and everything settles. And they’re like… [exhales] And then you gotta fire it up again and they’re like, “Oh, my gosh. This guy is relentless.” They’re thinking about what they did. Oh, he’s definitely getting rid of me. It’s not you, it’s me. I haven’t learned Spanish in 30 days. [audience laughing] This idiot couldn’t learn Spanish if he was raised in Guatemala for 30 years. [audience laughing] It’s why it’s so hard dragging an app. You ever tried to drag an app from another page? It’s like, nope. [audience laughing] Nope. I like page five. [audience laughing] I don’t trust doctors. Do you trust doctors? I don’t trust doctors, no. [audience] No! They’re killing people who don’t need to die. I read this one story. This one woman, she was comatose. She was in the hospital. And she came back to life and started breathing again moments after her family pulled the plug. Is that a good story? [audience laughing] Yeah, I mean, she’s living. That’s good. She’s back to life. That’d make for some pretty uncomfortable conversation in that hospital room. [audience laughing] Right after, when she came back. Like, she, whoa! This is amazing! I can’t believe you all were here waiting for me. My family. I love you so much. What have you guys been up to? [audience laughing] Uh, nothing, Mom, nothing. You weren’t, uh, looking so good, Mom. Frankie, unplug your iPhone, you’re at 85%, unplug it. [audience laughing] How’re you feeling, Mom? How you feeling? I feel wonderful. My side hurts a little bit. Yeah, that’s ’cause we’ve already donated all your organs. [audience laughing] They’re coming at three for your eyes. We should get a family photo before they pluck the eyes. Let’s get a family photo. Mom, get in here. Before we’re looking at two black, empty sockets. Let’s go. [audience laughing] Only God pulls the plug on me. I tell my family all the time. Absolutely, yes. I don’t care. He created me. He can take me out whenever He wants. Is it a matter of money? So what? Have a garage sale. [audience laughing] So the kids don’t go to college? Who cares? Let’s be honest, they weren’t going anyway. [audience laughing] Keep the big man breathing. Do whatever you gotta do. I tell them all the time. I don’t care. At some point, there’s gonna be that woman that walks in the room. There’s always… You know what? Kevin would not want to live this way. You falcon-punch that witch right in the throat. [audience laughing] You just grab her and… Stomp her, right there. [audience cheering and clapping] Double strike her. How about you don’t wanna live. Who’s that lady killing people? Just walking in, “He would not wanna go on. He would not wanna do it. There’s no quality of life.” Hi-ya! [audience laughing] I had a close call too, about five years ago. I was, uh, driving home from a show and I hit a deer on the highway. It was pretty scary. It was a horrible experience, wrecked my truck. I was on the side of the road, pretty shaken up. Filling out the police report. She was asking me questions and the officer was like, “What happened? The deer just, uh, jumped out in front of you?” I was like, “What?” [audience laughing] She was like, “Did it just jump out in front of you?” [audience laughing] I was like, “No, no, it waved me over.” Um… [audience laughing] I was barreling down the road about 90 miles and hour and I was like, is that a deer calling over with its hoof? Sure enough, it was. [audience laughing] I pulled over to the side. I was like, “What’s up?” He’s like, “You’re doing like 90.” And I’m like, “Okay, that’s my business. What do you care?” He’s like, “I know you got kids at home.” He knew my kids by name, which freaked me out. I’m like, I’m not gonna talk to this guy anymore. I don’t need this. I’m outta here. He’s like, “Hold up. Hold up. I’m sorry.” He said, “I’m sorry. Let’s started over. We’ll hug it out.” And I’m like, that’s pretty cool, a deer who’s about forgiveness. [audience laughing] I said okay, and go to hug him and he goes to hug me, and he goes, “What’s that?” and he points to my shirt. I go, “What’s what?” I look down, and he did that move in my face… [audience laughing] He goes, “I know where you live.” Then he ran into the woods. I got back in my truck and I started chasing him. But I couldn’t get through the thick trees, so I got out and camped out overnight. [audience laughing] And I waited. The next morning, I saw him. He was talking to a bunch of other deer. I army crawled over to him. And I put blueberries on my face all Rambo style. He didn’t even see me. I jumped on top of him. I sank my hooks in. I slit his throat and he bled out right there on the spot. Then I dragged him, like a mile. [audience laughing] Mile and a half, back to the highway and I threw him on the hood of my truck. [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when you showed up. [audience laughing] So, no, he did not just jump out in front of me. This was premeditated deer murder. [audience laughing] Can’t talk about my kids. I have four kids. Any parents? Lot of parents out there? [audience cheering] Yeah. Yeah. Trying to be a good dad, it’s, uh, it’s tough, man. It’s really hard. These, these times, it’s difficult, you know. I’m really having a tough time trying to motivate my kid',\n",
       "  's. And, I don’t know, like, I don’t know, is it me or is it, like, all parents? I don’t know. Are your kids lethargic? [audience laughing] ‘Cause I got a slug farm at my house. I really… [audience laughing] My kids don’t even get dressed anymore. They just get up from bed with the blanket. They have a blanket on them. They light up their iPad, it illuminates their face, and they just shuffle, shuffle. Like some weird sand creature in a Star Wars movie. Past each other and past me. No one talks anymore. [audience laughing] My son’s the worst, always on the video games. I was like, “Hey, we can’t do this, man. Let’s get some activity, you know.” I went up to him and said, “Hey. Buddy. Listen, let’s, let’s grab a football and, uh, call all your friends. We’ll get on our bikes and we’ll ride over to the field. Grab some cones, we’ll set up outlines and touchdowns and all the stuff. We’ll, we’ll have a great, great game. Awesome game. Maybe two. We’ll wait there till the lights come on in the parking lot. We’ll play a night game as well. We’ll just have a blast. And he just looked over to me and said, “I’m good.” [audience laughing] That was it. My wife goes, “Just take the video games away from him.” That’s a great idea. And I did. We took our video games away from all our kids. All the video games were done. Take them away from your kids. Yes. Yeah, we did it. [audience cheering and clapping] You gotta do it. We have to do it. It helped. It was awesome right away. First of all, the girls, my daughters, their life got so much better immediately. They were seeing friends and reading. They didn’t even care. My son had a tough time. He did. Yeah, he was having… Especially, couple days in, he started getting all shifty-eyed and stuff, looking at me just… [audience laughing] Little shaky leg. He was like an addict. He was really just kinda like… [audience laughing] I could tell he was having a tough time. He was… [audience laughing] [clears throat] Yo. Dad, yo, can I talk to you? Can I talk to your for a second? [audience laughing] Yo. C-Come over here, Brody. Let me talk to you for a second. Get away from Mom for just a second. [audience laughing] You gotta give me something to take the edge off. Give me a little something, a little brain tickler. Give me a little brain tickler. You got some Mario? [audience laughing] I was like, “No. No games, that’s it.” Okay, God bless you, sir. You have a good day. [audience laughing] You have a great day. God bless you, sir. I love you. God bless you. God loves you. You have a good day. Next day he came by, same thing. He’s a little manipulative too. You gotta watch out for him. I don’t know what he was trying to do. He was like, “Hey, how about this, Dad?” [clears throat] What if I got, like, a… an Oculus? I didn’t know what an Oculus is. Do you know? I didn’t even know. I had no idea. It’s the virtual reality, if you don’t know. The goggles. You put these big goggles on your face. And you’re in virtual reality. I was like, “Is it games?” He goes, “Yeah.” I’m like, “No, you can’t have it. That’s it, no games.” He goes, “But you don’t understand. These are active games.” I go, “What do you mean?” He goes, “Oh, it’s unbelievable. They have a boxing game where you can fight like Rocky or like, you know, Apollo Creed or Mohammad Ali. It’s, like, 12 rounds. And you have, like, hand weights. You’re boxing the whole time. You’re sweating like crazy. It’s amazing.” He goes, “There’s a dance cardio game where you’re, like, going crazy. Your heart rate goes through the roof. They also have a warrior game. There’s a warrior game, Dad, you wouldn’t believe it. You’re going through this village just wielding a sword. It’s like a crazy shoulder delt workout the whole time. Everybody’s doing it. All my friends, everybody is just working out like crazy. And here’s the best part, even if it’s raining outside or snowing, doesn’t matter. ‘Cause you get your workout in. It’s awesome.” [audience softly laughing] I was like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” I started thinking about it. I’d rather you be outside doing stuff, but maybe this is a step in the right direction. So I said, “All right, let’s get the Oculus.” And I got him the Oculus. [audience whooping] Yeah. Wanna tell you how it went down. [audience laughing] First day, he gets the Oculus. I wake up, I go downstairs into the kitchen. He’s already got it on. He’s just standing there in the kitchen. Big, fat goggles on his face, just… [audience laughing] Zero movement. Zero movement. Just standing there. I’m watching him. He doesn’t know I’m there. I walk in. I’m like, “What is this?” This is the Oculus? This is it? And he’s just there. I watch and I’m getting a little upset, but then he starts to move and I go, “Here we go.” He backs up a little bit. I’m like, “Whoa.” He doesn’t even know I’m there. He reaches under. He feels under the kitchen counter. And he gets a stool. [audience laughing] And he sits down. [audience laughing] Now I’m really getting upset. ‘Cause… he doesn’t look like he’s fighting Apollo Creed. [audience laughing] I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt. I don’t know this virtual reality. I don’t know how far it goes back. Maybe his trainer’s stuck in traffic or something. [audience laughing] But he’s just sitting there now. Just sitting there, for another two ',\n",
       "  'minutes. I’m getting upset. I’m about to take them off and he steps up. I go, “Oh, here we go.” He takes one step and levels up. He’s just standing there. I’m like, “Oh. Here we go.” He goes like this. I’m like, “All right.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I go, “Here we go.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. I’m like, “Yes, he’s warming up. Look at this.” Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. [audience laughing] And then he goes back to his perch. He just goes back. [audience laughing] I’m furious. I’m furious. But then he goes like this. He leans like this and then he goes like this. Then he goes like this. He starts going like this. [audience laughing] I’ve no idea what… No idea. Just this. I’ve had enough. I rip the goggles off his head. He’s like, “Oh, no!” Which I’m told you’re not supposed to do. It’s like waking a sleepwalker, you’re not supposed to do that. I put them on. I wanted to see what he was doing. You know what? He was playing a game. You know what game it was? Job Simulator. [audience laughing] He was working part time at a convenience store. [audience cheering and clapping] He was waiting for customers to come in his store. He was just sitting there. [audience laughing] He wasn’t active at all. He wasn’t sweeping up in between customers. Stacking cases of beer in the back. He was sitting there. He was sitting there and then, finally, a customer came in and he stepped up, leveled up, got him a pack of cigarettes or something. Rang him up, I saw the cash register was right there. Gave him the change. Nodded. He’s a polite kid. At least he’s got that going for him. Then he goes back to his chair. And I’m like, “What was this? What was this and all that?” You know what it was? He was scratching off his own lotto tickets. [audience laughing] He’s not even a good fake employee. [audience laughing] I just said, “You’re punished. That’s what it is. That’s what’s up.” I don’t know how to punish our kids anymore. I don’t even know what we can do, what we can’t do. I don’t even know what… I know our parents, our dads, they knew how to punish. Back in the day, they knew how to punish. They did. They had it exactly correct. Every… The punishment always fit the crime perfectly. Because they got the belt, that’s why. [audience laughing] Yes. You only had to get the belt once. You got the belt once, you never did whatever you were doing ever again. Then your dad just had to show you the belt. And that was enough. You remember that? Hey, what did you say? [audience laughing] Yeah, okay, I’m good. Yeah. [audience clapping] Yes. Belt worked. Remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was? You were popping off at your mom, You go like, “Hey. Mom, I’m not having your meatloaf tonight. It’s horrible. I’m not having it. It’s very dry. Who puts peas in meatloaf? I can’t do it. I can’t. It’s way too dry. Look up the recipe, Betty Crocker. Check it out, woman. Why is Dad getting undressed? What’s going on? What are you doing? [audience laughing] “No, add ketchup to it, I don’t care. Some sauce, get it going. It’s just horrible. It’s very dry. What’s up, Dad? Are you a lion tamer? What is this? What’s this snap, snap? Snap, snap. I don’t know… Oh, my God! Oh, God!” [audience laughing] And it worked. The belt’s worked since 25 BC. It’s worked throughout history. All the way up until, like, 1993 when some frail d-bag introduced the first time out. [audience cheering and clapping] And that’s when we lost society, right there. When everything burns and civilization comes to an end, we can trace it all the way back to that one guy. That’s the guy. Time out. It changed the game. Time out? How can you do that? Can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day? Hey, Dad, listen up. Very sorry about stealing your car last night, taking it for a joy ride. Doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front, but how’s about this? [audience laughing] Instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in New Orleans… [audience laughing] I’m thinking I’m gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bit. [audience laughing] Maybe think about where I went wrong, maybe not. I don’t even know. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I might sing a song, I might hum one. It doesn’t matter. Important thing is, it’s my time, it’s my time over in that corner. And when I feel good enough, and I feel like I’m ready to inject myself back into society, I will come back here and I will tell you and we’ll see how that goes. How do you feel about that, cowboy? How’s that? [audience cheering and clapping] Why are you getting undressed again? What’s going on? [audience laughing] Time out. They don’t even do time outs anymore. Now time outs are too cruel. They’ve become too cruel. Time outs. Oh, the ch… No, you can’t. What? You can’t do a time out. It’s too cruel for the child. They’re alone. They’re isolated. They’re in the corner of the room. By themselves. There are other people. They’re just… No, they’re way… It’s in a corner. They’re looking at two walls meeting. It’s, it’s too much for the child to deal with. You can’t isolate them like that. Any… You can’t. You just can’t isolate them. They don’t even do that ',\n",
       "  'anymore. They don’t do time outs anymore ’cause it’s too much. They do what’s called a time in. It’s called a time in. I’m serious. What they do is the dad will take the child, you sit in the middle of the room, they put the child next to them, they stroke their shoulder and… You both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where… the child went off the tracks. And… Once you start making them feel good about being bad… [audience laughing] Probably after, like, seven or eight minutes, you just let them go. Then you stay there for, like, an additional four minutes. [audience laughing] Just to think about what a loser of a parent you’ve become. [audience cheering and clapping] We’re raising baby veal. That’s what we’re doing. We are. We are. We are. We’re so easy on our kids. And so what? It doesn’t help them. I love my kids. We all love our kids. We know that. But you know what? They all can’t be the best. They can’t. Not right away, anyway. This is what we tell them, constantly. You’re the best. You are the best. You are so good. You are the best. You’re the best. Isn’t he the best? Yeah. He’s the best. You’re the best. He’s the best. You’re so good. You’re the best. [loud sigh] No, you suck. [audience laughing] You’re not… What are you the best at? We wanna get you to be the best, but you can’t do anything right now. What can you do? Can you match your socks? Can you do a back flip? Can you black tar a driveway? Can you roll a cigar? Can you drive a forklift? Can you put your toothbrush back in the cup when you’re done using it? [audience laughing and clapping] Nothing. Without me, you can do nothing. If I dropped you off in the woods you wouldn’t last ten minutes before you were eaten by coyotes. [audience laughing] Kids suck. They suck. [audience laughing] They’re not good. They’re not good. That should, that’s the definition of a kid. “You suck.” That’s what they should be called. How many you-sucks do you have? I’ve got one and two on the way. [audience laughing] Twin you-sucks? That’s amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. [audience laughing] Your kids suck. My kids suck. I’m sorry to break it to you. There’s one kid I saw on the internet. One kid. This four-year-old Korean boy. He was playing Mozart on an accordion. He had something special, nobody else. [audience laughing] But 100% he got the belt. Oh, he definitely got the belt. Oh, he was Mozarting his ass off. He was like… [audience laughing] That’s how you get good. [audience laughing] My son wanted to play Little League. So I called the coach. I said, “Listen, my boy wants to play. Is it okay if he joins the team?” He’s like, “Yeah, we didn’t even start practicing yet. We practice Thursday night.” I said, “That’s wonderful. It’s awesome. And, uh, I’ll bring him down.” He says, “Yeah, I just wanna let you know that we don’t keep score in this league.” [audience laughing softly] I say, “Why? Why not?” He’s like, “We don’t wanna upset… the parents and disappoint any of the kids, so we don’t keep score.” I was like, “Why even have them bat?” Why not just have them walk up to the plate, “Hi, how’re you doing?” [audience laughing] Could you put me down for a double? [audience laughing] Yeah, my mother says I preregistered for a double. I got a double. Thank you. I got a double, Mother! [audience laughing] A double. I got a double. Every kid gets a trophy. You know how I found out? There was a $40 charge on my bill. I was like… [audience laughing] What’s this right here? He like, “That’s for trophies.” We didn’t even have a practice yet. He’s like, “Congratulations, you guys won. You guys are champions.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “Who?” He’s like, “Everyone.” Everyone? Me? He goes, “Yeah. Did you drive him here?” I go, “Yes.” He goes, “Congratulations, you’re a winner.” [audience laughing] I played Little League in the 1970s. Played for five years. Got a trophy once. One year. That’s it. One trophy. You know why? ‘Cause we won. That’s it. [audience cheering and clapping] You know how I know? ‘Cause we kept score. [audience laughing] You know why we did that? ‘Cause that’s how baseball’s played. The team with the larger number, the more runs, they’re the winners. And the losers are the team with the less numbers. They’re the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better. And sometimes that drive actually helps them. That’s actually the better choice, to lose and try to come back, because it’s human nature. Human nature. [audience cheering] It’s good for them. One trophy. That’s all I had. I would go in my room and see that one trophy. I’d be like, “Oh, yeah. That’s the year we won.” That’s it. The one time. That was worth it. It was great. I went to my neighbor’s house. His living room is littered with trophies. I know his kids. I’m like, “This is criminal.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “What’s this one for?” Oh, that’s when Warren was gonna try out for photography club. [audience laughing] But he got a cold and missed the season. It says “MVP.” Yes, we’re very proud of him. [audience laughing softly] They’re so fortunate, kids today. They have the greatest fields, I see them, I see them here. The pristine sod and the outfield walls. With the sponsors and the, and the lights for night games. Kidding me? I played in the 70s and they had none of that. You pull up to, ',\n",
       "  'like, a parking lot with cement and clumps of grass and broken Schmidt’s bottles everywhere. Just… Is this field two? Yeah, this is field two. This is us. Your coach would pull up in a 1971 Impala, pop the trunk to hand out uniforms. [imitates trunk squeaking open] Had everything in that trunk. Clearly thrown out of his house ten minutes ago by his wife. [audience laughing] Smoking right in front of us. [audience laughing] Gather round, guys, gather round, team. Get around me. Make a circle. Listen to me, if it’s a hit to right field… shortstop got it covered. Second base… don’t overthrow the cutoff man, okay. You’re overthrowing the… Like a nicotine oscillating fan right in our faces. [audience laughing] No parents running over, “Hey, Phil, maybe you shouldn’t smoke in front of the kids.” You kidding me? They’re setting up snack tables, playing dominoes, drinking vodka, about 30 yards that way. [audience cheering and clapping] They’re just so happy the weird guy in the polyester pants and bushy mustache is looking after them for a while. Right in my face. Benson and Hedges. It stung right in the retinas. Stinging me like crazy. Smoke billowing down my body. But you know what? No allergies today. [audience cheering and clapping] Nada. I eat whatever I want. I can see a raccoon walking around midday. Just rip it’s face off, clumps of hair missing, doesn’t matter. I can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later. [audience laughing] You know why? ‘Cause I drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard. [audience cheering and clapping] That sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time, melting that plastic. It boiled up so much it would burn your face. It wouldn’t even come out in a steady stream. You’d be p-p-p-p-p… [audience laughing] Firing rusty spickets through that thing like BBs into the back of your throat until it wasn’t enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that. [audience laughing] Just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house. Just… [audience laughing] Go right to the source and I was fine. Why was I fine? ‘Cause all day long at school I’m chewing on pencils. [audience laughing] I’m sniffing magic markers like they’re going out of style. Thirty seconds a nostril. Have some fun. Get used to it. Eating paste ’cause it looked like mayonnaise. [audience laughing] Or Play-Doh. How good did Play-Doh smell? Smelled amazing. You try it, like, whoa, different story. [audience laughing] Next day, you try it again. Different color. You’re like, “Maybe this is fruit flavored. Try.” [audience laughing softly] We had allergies and things back in the day. We just didn’t label everything. I’m sure I had anxiety. I know I did. I was a pitcher. I was eight years old. I remember this. I had a really strong arm. I was on the mound. I was firing the ball, aiming it, and I was missing the plate. I started walking batters and it was getting to me. I loaded up the bases and I was breathing heavy. I felt it. I felt this heaviness. And it was bothering me. I started trying harder and I was walking more batters. I started walking runs in. I’m looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and I felt terrible. I remember this. ‘Cause I remember my dad, who was also a coach, he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. He literally walked up to the mound, he put both hands on my shoulder, looked me dead in the eyes and says, “Hey. Stop aiming the ball. You know what to do.” He said two words. “Just throw.” That’s all he said. “Just throw.” He turned around and he walked back to the dugout. And I remember it’s the greatest advice I’ve ever received in my entire life. Think about it. Anytime life has got you down, there are obstacles you gotta overcome. Just throw. That’s all you gotta do. Just throw. Yes. Believe in yourself. [audience cheering and clapping] Trust yourself. And just throw. And that’s what I did. I launched back into my windup and I just threw. And I shattered the kid’s cheekbone. I remember… [audience laughing and clapping] Ball bounced like 30 yards, two more runs scored. So my Dad was wrong there. You gotta aim the ball. [audience laughing] In baseball. That’s the… That’s like where… That’s the worst advice ever. To just, just throw it in baseball. Then you’re just running around, just throwing at everything. You can’t. You gotta… [audience laughing] Doesn’t work in baseball. But anywhere else in life, it’s great advice. Great advise. Just throw. Just do it. He was smart. My dad was a smart man. Never went to college. Didn’t have to. Didn’t know all subjects, but he knew subjects in depth. He had depth to the subject. That was it. He knew it. He knew it well. I don’t have that. I don’t know, my Dad was handing me the, uh, knowledge baton. He was literally like, “Here it is. From generation to generation. This is all the wisdom and intelligence of our family. And I’m giving it to you, my son.” And I was like… I’m good. [audience laughing] I don’t feel like reading that thing right now. I paid for it. ‘Cause he could answer any question I ever had. And I know nothing now. As an adult, I’m faking it. That’s why I hate having conversations. ‘Cause I don’t know enough. I know things, but I don’t ',\n",
       "  'have any in-depth knowledge. I can’t go deep. Still water does not go deep. That’s why, anybody talks to me, it’s literally like they say something and I have zero point of view. I can’t add anything to it. I’m just like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. [audience laughing] One subject, one subject I know a lot about. Buster Douglas. Remember him? Remember the heavy-weight champ who upset Mike Tyson back in 1990? At the Tokyo Dome. Forty-two to one odds. Mike Tyson was 37-and-0 at the time. 55,000 people there. I know all this. You know why I know it? Because ESPN had a 30 for 30 on it and I recorded it and watched it, like, 12 times. So I have all this information about Buster Douglas. Here’s the thing. Hardly ever comes up in conversation. [audience laughing] That’s how dumb I was. I put all my eggs in the Buster Douglas basket. [audience laughing] And my wife, this was the worst. We got invited to this local municipal government fundraising dinner. It was, like, every word I hated in there. Except dinner. I was fine with that. [audience laughing] Hope you said no. She was like, “I accepted.” Why would you do that? I don’t wanna talk to anybody. I can’t. I don’t know anything about government. They’re gonna make me look like an idiot. I don’t wanna do it. She’s like, “Relax.” She’s good at talking. She’s like, “I’ll go with you. I’ll be there the whole time. I promise you, we’ll mingle around, we’ll have some hors d’oeuvres, we’ll have a little dinner, and then we’ll leave. And I’ll stay with you the whole time.” You promise? She’s like, “Yes.” As soon as we get there she goes, “I’ll be right back. I have to go the bathroom.” And she takes off. [audience laughing] Some guy walks over to me. He says, “Hey.” I’m like, “Oh, gosh, here we go. Hey!” How about this whole Figueroa thing as councilman? Tell you one thing, he ain’t gonna last, huh? [audience laughing] Let’s break it down, shall we? First, don’t know who Figueroa is. Don’t know… You know what a councilman is? Do have any idea? He could’ve said carrot-maker. It wouldn’t have made a difference. I’ve no idea what a councilman is. [audience laughing] How do I answer? I wanna look like I know, so I go, “Really?” Like I’m concerned for Figueroa. He goes, “Yeah, really.” I go, “Why?” He goes, “I’ll give you one reason why. Treason.” I was like, “Treason? You gotta be kidding me.” In my head, I’m going, you don’t even know what treason means. [audience laughing] You don’t know the definition of treason. I don’t know… Did you ever break away from a conversation mentally to try to figure out a word that somebody just launched at you? You’re in your head, going, break it down. Treason. What does it mean? Treason. Well, tree is in the front, reason is in the back. Trees… are reasonable. Maybe he’s talking about the environment. Get in there and talk about the environment. So I go back to talk to him and he’s just staring at me. So I don’t know how long I was out for, you know. I don’t know if he asked me a question or not. He’s just staring at me. I’m starting to sweat, ’cause I don’t know what to say. I’m feeling uncomfortable. And he doesn’t say… So I go to my fallback, which is this. It’s great. I just go, “Yeah, it’s all crazy anyway. What are you gonna do, right? He’s supposed to say, “Yeah, it’s nuts. Anyway, you have a good night.” You too. But he doesn’t. He goes, “What’s crazy?” I go, “I don’t know. No one’s ever answered my question with a question before.” [audience laughing] Just the whole thing. He’s like, “What whole thing?” How it all went down. He’s like, “What went down?” Motherf… Just leave me alone! [audience laughing] He was trying to expose my stupidity. He wouldn’t stop. He was not letting me go. He was chasing me, like I was an opossum running behind a dumpster and he had a flashlight in my face. What did you say? No, you’re dumb. What did you say? You’re very dumb. You don’t know who Figueroa is. Who is Figueroa? No, you don’t. Who is Figueroa? Who is Figueroa? Who is he? You don’t… Name the three branches of government. [audience laughing] I’ll spot you Legislative. [audience cheering and clapping] I should just be honest with people. I should just walk up, “Hi, my name’s Kevin. I got about a fourth grade vocabulary.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna get lost pretty quickly into the conversation, but I’ll stay here and I’ll nod my head and I’ll smile, make you feel better about yourself, but don’t be fooled, I am dead behind the eyes. [audience laughing and clapping] I don’t do that. I try to match. I try to match. I throw in big words I don’t even know. What do you think the problem with society is? I go, “I gotta be honest. I harken…” Har… Harken. [audience laughing] I’ve never said “harken” before in my life. Harken? What am I? Winston Churchill? Where… It behooves me to think that… my monocle and my, mm, pocket watch, ha-ha, burlap brown pants, working on the cobble stone in London, fatty, fatty, fatty pants. Fatty pants. Walking in London rain. Who am I? Mm, pipe. Who am I? Harken. Or I answer too quickly. What do you think the problem with the culture is? I’m like, “I know what it is.” I know what it is? [audience laughing] I go, “I think it’s a lack of conscious.” Conte-ness. Consci-ness. He’s like, “What?” You ever not even be sure of the tense of a word? C… It’s a lack of con… conscien',\n",
       "  'ce-ness. [audience laughing] I’m sorry, what did you say? C-Con… It’s a lack of consciention… [audience laughing] It’s a lack of con… uncon… I think unconscien… unconscientuously. I think uncon… con… Conscience… Conchi… It’s a lack of conch… Of we’re not uncontentience. [audience laughing] You’re gonna have a society… S-so… So-socotal… Socielitally… You’re gonna get a tyranny. A tyr… A tyran… An tyrannical-saurus rex is gonna come back. [audience laughing] And the dinosaurs are here. That’s what I’m saying. I’m sorry, I’m not following you. I went… [scoffs] Irregardless of that, I gotta tell you… I said it. [audience laughing and clapping] Oh, he stopped me, “That’s not even a word.” I beg to differ. He’s like, “I’m sorry, you’re not making any sense.” [audience laughing softly] You know what else didn’t make sense? When Buster Douglas upset Mike Tyson back in 1990. [audience cheering and clapping] At the Tokyo Dome. 55,000 people. Forty-two to one odds. You have a good night, sir. Have a good night, sir. [audience clapping] That’s when my wife walked out of the bathroom. What did I miss? Anything good? Ha-ha. Okay. All right. My wife’s awesome. I love her so much. She… We’re an amazing fit because she loves to talk. She’s like the balance to me. She’s so good at it. She can talk to people. She knows what questions to ask. She just loves it. I remember, that night we got in the car to drive home. She just started talking again. I was like, “Hey. You know, we don’t need it now. We…” [audience laughing] We don’t need to talk ever again. [audience laughing] We don’t. That’s a good thing. We’ve been together, like, 20 years. I’ve already said every word I’m ever gonna say to her in every combination. That’s it. And she said every word to me. She knows everything about me. I know everything about her. We don’t need to talk anymore. We can finish out the rest of our life with gestures. That’s it. [audience laughing] Not her. She loves to talk. She loves it. She’s just one of those people. She just loves it. Loves the sound of her internal voice. She’s like, “Uh…” Loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something. The whole nine yards. Whatever’s involved with talking, she… [makes noises] Ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice? They’re ma-ma-ma-ma. Brr… Brr… Brr… La-la. Brr… She just goes. I don’t think she’s ever had an unexpressed thought in her life. [audience laughing] No. Everything she sees, it goes right in, and she has to say it. She just, “Oh, my gosh, this door’s so squeaky. That picture’s crooked, I can’t believe that. We’re gonna make eggplant for Thursday. We’ll have some friends over. Would that be good? Look at my reflection in the mirror. I see two of me. Do you see two of me? It’s really weird. I can’t believe the kids are standing on hardwood floor now, look at that. The lights are good. The holidays are coming. This is fun.” Hey, sit one out. Sit one out. [audience laughing] I have thoughts in my head all day long. Weird ones. How many tater tots can I fit in my mouth without dropping any? [audience laughing] It’s in there, but I keep it in the barn. I keep it in there. Not my wife. She doesn’t have any barn doors. It’s just free-range thoughts. I see it. I say it. I see it in the senses and I say it. Look at those exit signs. The light. The floor. Everything is… I see it. I say it. I see it. I say it. It’s like a verbal wood chipper. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] I see it. I say it. I gotta say it when I see it. I see it. I say it. I gotta say it. [imitates chipper whirring] [audience laughing] Hey. There’s an ebb and flow to conversations. There is. Fifty percent is listening. It’s like double Dutch. You gotta wait for your turn. [audience laughing] Not her. She’s in there the whole time. Like… I got this. This is my talk. This is my talk. Back it off. Can someone else talk? Get outta here, [unclear], this is me. Big Mac, Fillet-o-Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries, I see Coke, milkshake, sundaes, and apple pie. [audience cheering and clapping] You wanna talk? Talk. Go in your closet, take your clothes off, and talk all night long. But why do I have to be there? [audience laughing] It’s this emotional backboard. She doesn’t care what I think or say. She wants me there. Why? Talk. Go. I always gotta be there, though. I’m literally brushing my teeth. Getting ready for bed. And I hear it. [audience laughing] Telling me things. That I experienced with her. I was with her all day. [audience laughing] Can’t believe Alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son. I didn’t like that at all. I couldn’t believe it. Could you believe it? In my head, I’m going, “Yes, I can. You know why? ‘Cause I was there.” [audience laughing] This was your point of view. [audience laughing] This was mine. I was there. I experienced everything with you! Na-na-na-na-na… Talking herself to sleep. Literally talking herself through sleep. You know how much you wanna go to sleep and you’re tired? And she’s still fighting it. [mumbling] [exhale, mumbling] [mumbling] Finally. It goes quiet. Sweet quiet. You go to bed. Next morning I wake up. [audience laughing softly] I’m brushing my teeth. And it starts up again in the other room. [audience laughing] I’m like, “What new knowledge did you pick up…” [audience laughing',\n",
       "  '] “…overnight?” What did you get? What could you have picked up? Nothing new happened. [audience laughing softly] But she wants me there. She wants me in that conversation. Again, doesn’t care about what I have to say. Does… doesn’t matter. She wants me there. And she tries to get me snagged into these conversations. She’ll like lob out half sentences to me. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me. [loud sigh] I sure hope Ellen’s gonna be okay. [audience laughing] I usually let the first one just pass by. [audience laughing] ‘Cause if enough time passes, I can just kinda… [mumbles] [audience laughing] But there’s always a follow-up. Sure hope they can work through this. Okay, we gotta engage. [audience laughing] I’m thinking, “What’s our plan?” Our plan is, we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible. We have so much stuff to do. But we can’t try to shorten the conversation. We know that, ’cause she’ll sense that. She’s good at that. And then she’ll tack on 45 minutes just out of spite, so… [audience laughing softly] What if I steer into it? What if I go in the other way? It’s dangerous, but it’s… Risky move, but it could pay off. Let’s just go into it and I did it. Hey, honey. Yeah. Let’s do it. Let’s do what? Let’s just talk about Helen all morning long. [audience laughing] Let’s just do it. We’ll grab a couple of beanbag chairs. Put on a pot of coffee. We’ll sit down. You tell me everything about Helen from conception to this morning. [audience laughing] Let’s do it. Let’s just get knee-deep in Helen. What do you say? Okay, first of all, it’s Ellen. It’s not Helen. There’s no H, okay? [audience laughing] She’s my friend from Pilates who you don’t know. She’s going through some stuff right now. But let’s do it. Let’s just do it anyway. I don’t care. I wanna learn about her. And I wanna be here to learn about her, with you. What do you say? [loud exhale] [audience laughing] No. I promised her I wouldn’t say anything to anybody. [audience laughing] Okay. I really wanted to be here for you. I love you. I just wanted to let you know that. I’ll see you later, okay. [audience cheering and clapping] There’s always a follow-up. All right, I’ll tell you. But you gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody else. Promise you? I can’t do that. What if I’m playing softball with the guys? And we’re warming up and I’m throwing with my buddy and he’s like, “Hey, anything going on with your wife’s friends at Pilates that I should know about?” [audience laughing] I can’t believe you brought that up. Yes. Guys, bring it in. Everybody, bring it in, both teams. Come out of the dugout. Everybody, take a knee. I wanna tell you about my wife’s friend Ellen or Helen, who I don’t know, from Pilates. [audience laughing] She’s going through some stuff right now. No, hands down, I’ll answer questions afterwards. [audience laughing] You gotta promise me you’re not gonna tell anybody. How about I promise you I’m not listening to a word you’re saying as you’re saying it? How about none of your words are actually reaching my ears? Nothing. Nothing. They’re exploding in the atmosphere before they reach me like a fourth of July party, like… [soft popping sounds] I can’t believe… [popping sounds] I can’t believe she named… [popping sounds] And I told her her coworkers… [popping sounds] I’m getting none of this. [popping sounds] I’m getting none of it. [popping sounds] I didn’t even know you were taking Pilates. [popping sounds] [audience laughing] Just gotta beat her at her own game. That’s all you gotta do. Fourteen. What? Fourteen. What? That’s how many tater tots I think I can fit my mouth without dropping any. You guys are the greatest!

       " ['[Hip-hop music playing] ♪♪ [Cheers and applause] Miami, make some noise… [Cheers and applause] For Mr. Marlon Wayans! ♪♪ ♪♪ How the fuck we doing, Miami? [Cheers and applause] Thank you. I love you, too! Thank you. I do. I really do love you guys. I mean, I swear. I love people. I’m a lover of life. You know what I mean? Life in general. And it’s like, as you get older, I learned, I’m like 90% love, but there’s, like, 10% of shit I hate. A lot of things I hate… Well, people hate… Come from fear, right? The thing I hate most comes from the thing I fear most. And it comes from, like, childhood trauma. And this is gonna sound crazy to you, but… [Sighs] Okay, fuck it. I am so scared of n*ggas with outie belly buttons. It’s just something evil about a n*gga with a outie belly button. You know what I’m talking about? Like, Andre McLaurin… he had an outie belly button. He was the bully in my hood. He terrorized me my whole childhood. He was an evil little n*gglet. 4 years old, he was buff. Look like Kevin Hart buff. Like… Looked like he just got out of baby prison and shit. And he was a kid. 4 years old, he had lats. The only way you get lats is from doing prison time and doing pull-ups. He was a badass little kid. He was so evil, his first baby tooth, it came in chipped. [Laughter] And he was an evil fucker. He used to always steal the one cherry out of my fruit cocktail at lunchtime. And if you went to a public school, you know how much that fucking one cherry meant to you? It took you 15 cups to get to the fucking cherry. Otherwise, it was all grapes and fucking nectarines. Yo, I don’t want that shit. I want a cherry! And Andre, he had an outie belly button, right, and he had this six-pack. And the outie belly button looked like someone threw a Vienna sausage at that n*gga’s stomach and it caught. [Grunts] He was bowlegged. All them little outie belly button dudes, they… They all bowlegged ’cause they mama make ’em walk when they only 5 months old before their legs harden. [Laughs] And then she give him… Because she doesn’t believe in walkers or strollers. She goes, “Those are for pussies!” She make him walk when he 5 months old and she give him man responsibility, ’cause you know his daddy ain’t there. Oh, outie belly button n*ggas ain’t got no daddy, shit. And they make them go… “Take your little brother Lamar to school!” And she put Lamar on his neck, and be, “I’ll take him,” and that weighed down his legs. So he walk around with heavy-ass Lamar on his shoulders, and now he gotta go, “Take Dede to daycare!” And now he gotta drag his little brother Dede to daycare. “Come on!” And she always screams shit to him out the window. Quit smoking my Newports! “I know it’s you, you piece of shit!” That was his little nickname. “Piece of shit!” He be out till, like, 5:30 in the morning with his saggy diaper full of shit, just… Oh, they ain’t potty trained. Outie belly button n*ggas is dumb as shit. They can’t read or write or don’t know their ABC’s or 123s, but they’re super athletic. They can backflip into a public pool with their jeans and sneakers on. So he walking around the neighborhood just looking for trouble with a little saggy-ass diaper hanging out his fucking G-Star jeans, and he just looking for trouble. Walking around the neighborhood, smoking his mama’s cigarettes, just…[Inhaling] But he’s still a kid, so he suck his thumb, too. [Laughs] Never fight a b*tch with a outie belly button. You will lose that fight. Oh, let me tell you something, outie belly button women, they can do two things. They can fight, and they can fuckin’ Double Dutch. Oh, shit. They always got Vaseline in their back pocket. And they put it on their face and say evil shit like, “Oh, b*tch, this what I wanted you to do! Oh, b*tch, I prayed for God you was gonna fuck with me today, ho! Ooh, I’ma fuck you up.” And they always got… They always got little… Little “B*tch, I can fight” hairdos. They got cornrows, right? But the cornrows be real little, ’cause they ain’t got a lot of hair, so it look like stitches. Look like Wolverine went… [Deep voice] “Get over here, b*tch!” [Normal voice] And they hair’s so small [chuckles] the shit be unraveling. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So they put them little colorful hair braids on the back, but half the time, they can’t afford that, so they put them Venus and Serena braids… Beads… on the end, and clump them with some aluminum foil? And God forbid if she got that “b*tch, I could fight” ponytail. You know them little ponytail? It look more like a Rottweiler tail or a Doberman Pinscher tail? It’s a little struggle tail. Oh, and her girlfriend help her get that little bit of hair in a ponytail, be like, “Shit, sit still, Faye, sit still! We almost got it!” And the hair never make it. The ponytail never make it. All this be broke off. There will be, like, nine scraggly hairs here and, like, seven over here. And she gotta slick it down with some Vaseline and try to make some baby hair. But one time she sweat, boom, that shit come right back up. And all this be bald as shit. This be bald. Look like somebody fading her shit at all times. But it’s ’cause all',\n",
       "  ' the stress from trying to have a ponytail when, b*tch, you ain’t got no hair, so… Her eyes be s… Real tight, you know? She got the tight eyes? It’s because she actually gotta put her skin in the ponytail to make the ponytail reach. And when it reaches, it’s finally, it’s a little, little ponytail. [Child’s voice] Oh, it’s so little! And it look like… [Normal voice] B*tch look like a water balloon. I’ma give you some stats on outie belly button people, and then we can move on, ’cause I’m really offending this brother with the outie belly button in the front row. Him and his comrade. Uh, these are real statistics. You can look it up after the show. Uh, Google it. Whatever search engine you use, Safari perhaps. Firefox. Uh… [Exhales sharply] They’re terrible people, outie belly buttons, they menaces to society. You know that 87.3% of our entire prison system is filled with n*ggas with outie belly buttons. 84.6% of all the fathers that don’t take care of their children. It’s a shame. Outie belly b… [Laughs] Every rapper that’s ever been to prison? The n*gga got a outie belly button. I ain’t lyin’. They always got they shirt off in pictures. Google it. Meek Mill… outie belly button. Lil Wayne… outie belly button. Bobby Shmurda and his whole crew of… ♪ We be on some block b*tches ♪\\n♪ To the tone, to the tone to the top ♪ All got outie belly buttons and saggy Pampers hanging out their G-Star jeans. Ready? Lil Baby and DaBaby outie belly button. Ready for this? Kodak Black. Yeah, this n*gga got a outie belly with a outie belly button. Oh, he’s an anomaly. It’s not just a Black thing, okay? White folks, you sitting here, having a good old laugh at us minorities. [Imitating White voice] [Laughs] [Normal voice] This is the biggest stat of all. Ready, White folks? 99.99%… of all them White folks that bum-rushed the Capitol… [Laughter] [Cheers and applause] The insurgents all had outie belly buttons. [Laughs] Donald Trump got a outie belly b… [Laughs] That’s why he wears those long ties. He’s trying to hide it. [Chuckles] I know, this is real shit. You know what’s funny? I almost didn’t have children, because I was afraid one of them was gonna have an outie belly button. I got kids, got two. [Applause] Yes. Some brave woman let me cum in her twice. And that’s 90 p… I love them, man. My daughter, she just graduated, uh, high school. [Cheers and applause] And she went to her prom. Yeah. Which for the father of a daughter is a miserable fucking evening. No, ’cause, you know, prom night, that’s the night that your baby girl’s gonna lose her virginity. Ladies, y’all ain’t shit. Y’all ain’t shit. Ain’t nobody correct me. None of y’all are worth a damn cent. Look at y’all. You gonna sit here and let me and your n*gga next to you believe that you lost it prom night? Yeah, right. You know you lost that shit in the tenth grade in some fucking stairwell to a random Puerto Rican named Orlando. [Chuckles] Prom night’s just the first night your nasty ass gonna do it in the bed, and your daddy gotta pay for it. See, I don’t… I don’t like the setup ’cause I feel like a sucker as a father. “Cause prom night is not about impressing the daughter or the mother. No. See, the mother and the daughter, they in cahoots with this little motherfucker across town, who’s trying to come fuck your daughter. That’s what they’re trying to do, fuck your daughter. What’s he doing? Trying to fuck your daughter. And he come, and he come, he think he Prince Charming. He pull up in a limousine. Oh, he’s wearing a tuxedo, and he has these shiny tuxedo shoes on. And he rings the doorbell all respectfully. [Imitates doorbell] Boom-boom. And you open the door, and he says some really polite thing like, “How are you, Mr. Wayans? It’s a pleasure to meet your acquaintance. I’m here to pick up Amai.” And then he produces a corsage. “Ooh, a corsage! Ooh, for my daughter?” Oh! You gentleman, you! Here. Fuck her. “You fuck my daughter, you gentleman, you!” Get the fuck outta here with that bull… Slap you in your little face. Don’t come to my door with that shit. Don’t do that. You come to my house, you trying to bang my daughter, be a man! You wanna pick up my daughter? Be a man. Don’t come in some limousine your daddy rented for you. No, I’m not impressed. You come in some shit you could afford. You show up to my house on them little… Little scooty bikes you rent in the street, like… Yeah, better yet, come on a skateboard. Just come to the house like, “Ka-ta, ka-ta, ka-ta.” Impress me! Do a trick up the stairs or some shit. Oh! And don’t wear no tuxedo. I’m not impressed by that shit. Nah, don’t wear no tuxedo. Some rent-a-tux. Come on, man. You wear it today, but it was on a dead body yesterday. You smell like embalming fluid. You come to my house, you show up… I’m a ’90s n*gga. So you come to my house, impress me. You wear a pair of FUBU jeans. Yeah, some Karl Kani, something with some big writing on the pocket. And make sure you have an Aniche shirt and a Mecca sweater over that. Tie a Phat Farm cardigan around your neck. Yeah, and then have a Eight-Ball jacket just sitting off your shoulders like Dom Perignon. And then you have a Ya',\n",
       "  'nkee fitted that’s not that fitted just sitting off the side of your dome. And don’t bend the brim. Leave that shit new! Don’t bend the brim. And you better not take the sticker off. I wanna see that little black sticker with your head size. I wanna be like, “Oh! Seven and five eighths? Oh, he got a big-ass head. He’s smart!” And when you come to my house, do me a favor. Don’t ring my doorbell. [Imitating doorbell] Boom-boom. Nah. Nah. Let’s be real. You don’t come to me with disguising your evil R&B Trey Songz intentions, nah. You tryin’ to fuck my daughter. “Boom-boom” says, “Love you!” Get the fuck outta here. Come with some… Knock on my door. Knock! Let me hear you knock. Don’t ring my doorbell. Knock. Yeah, that’s a real n*gga right there. And let me hear your intentions in the knock. I wanna hear your knock say, “I’m here to fuck your daughter!” You feel me? That… that gets my attention. “Boom-boom” don’t get my attention. N*gga, I be on the toilet taking a shit, I hear “Boom-boom, boom-boom,” I ignore it. I just keep checking my Instagram. “Boom-boom, boom-boom,” dropping my load. [Grunts] “Boom-boom.” [Grunts] “Boom-boom.” But if I hear, “I’m here to fuck your daughter!” I be like, “Oh, shit, he here!” I don’t even wipe my ass. I just pull up and be like, “Oh, he here! He here, n*gga!” I’ll wipe later. And when I open the door, do me a favor. Don’t say no smart shit to me like, “How are you doing, Mr. Wayans? Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I’m here to pi…” I’ll choke you, pussy! Don’t… Don’t do that. Just shut the fuck up. You come to bang my daughter, let’s be real. Don’t say nothing. Have some fucking empathy. What you trying to do, huh? You trying to love her? No, no. You trying to fuck my daughter. Let me tell you something, my guy, that’s my b*tch. Yeah, my pussy made that pussy, so respect the guy when you come through! Don’t say no smart shit to me, [Mocking voice] “How you doing Mr. Way…” [Normal voice] Shut up! Just look at me and have some compassion, have some empathy. You took your S.A.T.? That’s a S.A.T. word. You took your S.A.T.’s, you got a 870 or over, you know what the fuck empathy is. “Cause you give me that look like you know what the fuck I’m going through as a father. I open the door, be like… [makes creaking sound] “Just give me that look like you understand, like…” [Exhales] [Sighs] Then say some cool shit like… [Inhales deeply] [Deep voice] “You know what it is.” [Normal voice] “You know what it is.” That’s real n*gga talk right there. You won my heart with “You know what it is,” ’cause “You know what it is” says so much without saying shit. So, let’s say like… And brothers understand this. Like, let’s say I’m leaving the amphitheater tonight and I see some young brothers outside and they wanna rob me. And they see it’s me, and they be impressed like, “Oh, shit!” N*gga, that’s Marlon Wayans! Oh, I love you! Wayans Brothers? Wayans Brothers? Wayans Brothers? Come on, my guy. ♪ We brothers ♪\\n♪ We happy and we singing and we colored ♪\\n♪ Da-da-da-da ♪\\n♪ Gimme a high five! ♪ That was my shit. Yo, ‘Little Man’? Yo, I cried at ‘Little Man’, ’cause I got a cousin that small, man, so I know that shit be real. “And then ‘White Chicks’? Yo, that shit was a lit…” [Cheers and applause] “Yo, that… Yeah, it was a little gay, but, n*gga, that shit was funny though. But, yo, yo, I love y’all, man! Yo, my family love your family, but, yo…” [Sniffs] “Me and my n*ggas is hungry.” And you got that little chain on, you know what I’m saying? And I like them sneakers you got on. So as much as I love you… [sniffs] “You know what it is.” [Cheers and applause] [Normal voice] Somebody give me that shit, and here, “Take the chain. Take my sneakers.” That’s a real n*gga right there. Don’t even pull the gun out, just take it. The heist is done. Same thing with my daughter. “N*gga, here, take her, take her, take her. She deserve a real n*gga like you.” And then when you grab her, grab her hand and be like, “Yo, listen, you did a good job, man. Just do yourself a favor. Don’t wait up.” And pull up on your skateboard, ka-ta, ka-ta, ka-ta. And don’t let her on. Let her chase after you like a real n*gga. And then turn around and show me your outie belly button like, “You know what it is! You know this shit is real!” I actually had no anxiety at all on my daughter’s prom night. Not a drop. Know why? ‘Cause my daughter’s gay, so, yeah. [Chuckles] That took all… All the anxiety away. You know what’s funny? Knowing that my daughter wasn’t gonna be banging some dude or getting pregnant or having no disease, I… That doorbell rang, I was so relieved. I went to the doorbell… Boom-boom! I looked through the peephole, I seen it was a girl, I said, “Yes!” [Laughs] “Ooh, this b*tch is bad, too. Hey, how you doing? Ah, don’t call me Mr. Wayans, call me Mama!” [Smooches] “Amai, your date is here!” Oh, baby girl, don’t you look beautiful? Look at you. Don’t she look pretty? But why your dress so long, girl? Hike your dress up. Yeah, show some pussy. She ho… Yeah. Girl, you safe. This like fishing. Throw that chum in the water. Go on, show some pussy! “Now, you girls have fun. Don’t do noth',\n",
       "  \"ing I wouldn’t do.” [Evil laugh] “Now, check it out, I got y’all a little hotel room, and guess what? It’s a suite! Curfew? B*tch, stay out till Thursday, yeesh.” “Now, check it out, I got y’all some party favors.” I got you, uh [sniffs] I got you a little bit of weed. Just tell the driver you want some collard greens, he got that shit rolled up for you. I got you some liquor. I got that good liquor. I got that Ciroc. Yeah, that shit that make Diddy and his kids dance like this. Every time they hear “Ciroc,” they just be dancing like this. Here, take this Molly. Take the Molly. Don’t do the whole pill. I got this shit from Miami, “I don’t know what the fuck is in this shit.” [Cheers and applause] “Just give her half, and you take the other half. You do the whole thing, trust me, it’s gonna be really hard for you to eat vagina like this.” [Chuckles] That’s just how it was, man. I ain’t trippin’. My daughter told me she was gay when she was, uh, she was how old? She was 15 years old. And, uh, you know, I realized I’m not God. I can’t judge. I’m a father. And my job as a father is to love my daughter unconditionally, no matter what. So, I told my daughter, you know, I said, “Listen, baby girl,” I said, “You know, I accept you, but for you,” I said, “Don’t be concreted in your thoughts”, because you’re still a baby. I mean, life is not a sprint. This is a marathon. “And what you love today, you may hate tomorrow.” And I cited an example, I said, “Remember when you was little, you hated peas?” Yeah, you did. You fucking hated peas. And what did we do? We went to the bookstore, and we got that book. ‘Green Eggs and Ham’ by Dr. Seuss. Now who loves peas? You do! Right, so let’s go to the bookstore, and let’s see if we can find another book. ‘Green Eggs and Dick’ by Dr. Seuss. Yeah, and Daddy will read it to you “like I did when you was little.” [Clears throat] “‘You can suck it in the park.” You can fuck it in the dark. You can suck it in the rain. Watch out for big, buff, Black dick. It will surely give you pain. Oh, dick, it comes in all shapes. Some are narrow, some are wide! Some are round at the top and others have sleeves. They call those uncircumcised. And if you know these dicks I’m speaking, the uncircumcised ones usually belong “to Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.'” [Laughter] [Chuckles] No, but my daughter was like, “No, Dad, you’re not getting it.” She said, “I’m gay, so you love me or you leave me alone.” And she gave me two options, but I only heard one, which is to love her, right? Yeah. I mean, it actually made me look at myself. Like, the fact that she’s living her truth? I picked up the mirror and I said, “Shit, am I living my truth? I’m lying here next to her mother every night, and this shit don’t feel right.” “I’m wearing these skinny-ass leather pants that’s giving me male camel toe. What the fuck is going on?” And I realized something. I wasn’t living my truth. And I thanked my daughter. I said, “Thank you, you freed me.” I said, “Baby girl, Daddy likes pussy, too.” “I do! Oh, I love pussy! Not your mama’s. I’m tired of that shit.” I’ve been fucking that for 25 years. It’s like an old piece of chewing gum. I just wanna put it up underneath a desk and watch it get on somebody else’s jeans and be laughing. I’ve learned I like all kinds of pussy. I like White pussy. Yes, I said it, sisters. And I’ll say it to your face. I like White pussy. So white, you can hear the “H” when I pronounce it. Hh-white! And look at this brother, he smiling. He said, “Man, me too!” And I like them a little racist. I like a little Karen. I’ll go down… I’ll go down to Sarasota and grab me a fucking Karen, and I’ll fuck her ass and change her whole perspective. I’ll put that dick so deep, she’ll be like, [Screaming] “Black Lives Matter!” [Cheers and applause, laughter] And I like Latina chocha. Sí! Me gusta Latina chocha mucho! Yeah, I like the gorda labias. Ah, yes. And [with accent] yes, yes. [Normal voice] And then I fuck, and she fucking call me names, she like, “Ay, negrito sucio!” And I say, “Sí.” Negrito su… cio!” And I like Black. I like Black, Black, Black, Bla-a-a-a-a-a-ck pussy. I’m talking fucking Black Lives Matter black. Civil Rights Movement black. Wyclef Jean’s kneecap black. Bobby Brown crack finger black. [Laughs] Wesley Snipes’ everything black. And that pussy been through so much. All Black women been through so much trouble and oppression. She ain’t impressed by nothing you do. You can’t hurt that pussy. You pull their panties down and pussy got attitude, look at you like, “Tsk.” “That’s all you got?” [Sighs deeply] Ah, it feels so good to live my truth. Thank you, baby girl, for accepting me. [Sighs] Come on. Let’s go live our truth. Let’s go tell your mother, huh? You first, b*tch. I’ll be over here. I’m proud. I’m so proud of her that Pride month passed, and I put a post up on my Instagram. And I wrote her a beautiful caption. I said, “Happy Pride Month to my pride and joy. I’m so proud of you for living your truth, for having the courage to just be you.” I said, “Daddy loves you to the moon and back”, around the stars, through every galaxy. And one day, when God tak\",\n",
       "  'es me, may he bring me back again to find you exactly the way you are and love you for the rest of eternity. “Love always, Daddy.” [Applause] But you know, on Instagram, there’s always that one comment. That one negative n*gga with a little dick. Lonely, insecure, mad he living in his mama’s basement that’s full of fucking mold. Well, this piece of shit… Chaz0135. He writes, “I can’t believe you would teach your daughter this.” I said, “Hey, motherfucker. I didn’t teach this little girl how to be gay!” How do you teach somebody to be gay? Tell me. What do you think I did? You think I sat her down and told her her alphabets like this? “Listen, fuck ABC. All you need to know is LGBTQ. That’s all!” I didn’t teach her to be gay. Sometimes that’s just the way they are. I need y’all to listen to your kids. I should have known she was gay. You know how? I remember when my daughter was born, right? My daughter was three… My daughter was three and a half weeks late when we gave birth to her. Three and a half weeks. We had to induce labor. We used Pitocin to get her out. Her mother was in labor for 42 hours, trying to push this little girl out. So obviously, this little b*tch loved pussy! But see, I wasn’t listening. So I look at guys like Chaz0135, and I go, “Listen, sometimes that’s just the way the child comes. And how dare you try to shame a young lady that’s just trying to find her way in the world.” That shit pissed me off. I’m a troll, I went to that motherfucker’s profile, I started looking… Thinking of jokes. Oh, I called my brothers. Yes, I called for backup. I said, “Shawn, Keenen, Damon. Instagram. Chaz0135. Koo-koo!” [Applause] Oh, we a family full of n*ggas. They hit me back with the “Soo!” Yeah, and I was starting to… Like, we about to light him up with jokes, but then I saw that Chaz0135 had a brand-new baby girl. And so I seen where his insecurity was coming from. So I instantly called my boys off, called the boys off, was like… [makes bird sound] Oh, that’s bird talk for “Back up, back up, back up.” And they hit me back with the…[makes bird sound] That’s, “Alright, n*gga, you good, you good, you good.” [Chuckles] Because I know some… I’m gonna tell you something. I’m a… I’m a man of God. “No weapon formed against me shall prosper.” Yes. I saw the same Tyler Perry movie as you, sister, same one. Because you realize something, that there’s a karma to life. You ain’t gotta do nothing to bad people. Let me tell you something, Chaz0135. One day when your baby girl grows up, and she turns 19, and she comes out the closet. I’m gonna have my daughter fuck her! ‘Cause I’m a motherfucking troll like that. [Laughter] Guess what? I got gay friends. You should see the looks that I get from people when I hang out with my gay friends. Even my straight guy friends be looking at me when I hang out with my gay guy friends. They be looking at me like, “Oh, hey, watch out, bro. Watch out.” “Watch out for what? This shit ain’t contagious. This shit ain’t COVID. Like, you can’t catch gay, n*gga, like…” You acting like I hang out with my gay friends and I catch gay and I show up the next day and I’m just coughing up dick. “Hey, Marlon, how you doing?” “I don’t feel so good!” “What happened to you?” “Oh, I hung out with Aubrey, and he sneezed on me, and I just been coughing up dick all day!” [Sneezes] “Oh, I keep this up, I think I’m gonna have to call in dick to work. This getting crazy.” No, can’t catch gay. And I’m glad I got my gay friends. ‘Cause that’s who I consulted with when it was time for me to figure out my daughter. I sat my gay buddy down, I said, “Hey, bro,” I said, “Let me ask you ask you a question.” I said, “When did you know you were gay?” He looked at me, he said, [Effeminate voice] “Well…” [Normal voice] He… he did. He got… he got noodley on me. He said, [Effeminate voice] “Well…” [Normal voice] And he made this little noise. He went [clicks tongue] I said, “What the fuck? What was that noise? You just pull off an imaginary penis to answer my question?” [Laughs] You know, me and my friend, we continued to talk. He asked, “What are you gonna do?” And I said, “I’m gonna accept her.” And he said, “That’s the only thing you can do. I wasn’t so lucky. I haven’t spoken to my father since the day I came out.” And that shit fucked me up, man. That shit had me thinking. I was like, “Damn. What if it was my son that was gay?” Like, what would that prom night be like? Let’s go on a little journey. [Chuckles] Doorbell rings. “Boom-boom.” I get all excited. Yeah, let’s see what he working with! [Laughs] [Screams] Unh-unh. What in the fuck? Aw. This n*gga. “Shawn, come downstairs, your dick is here.” I mean, your date is here! Yeah, there’s weed in the glove box. Roll me a blunt, please. Shit, I need one. Uh, also, guys, I-I got you some, uh, liquor. I got liquor. I got Ciroc in there. Yeah, yeah, you can drink the Ciroc. But also I got you some Hennessy. You may wanna pour the brown liquor on your booty hole and just numb it up a little “before you do what you’re gonna do.” And I be like, “Here, here, hey, guys, here. Take the Molly. Take the Molly. Wait, how… how tall are you? 6’4”? ',\n",
       "  'Oh, Goddamn, here take five. May be a little easier for you to take that dick “if you’re a little bit high.” Like…[groans] But then I would take a beat, and I would think to myself that on the other side of my fear is my son. My child that God gave me, the boy that I raised. And no child deserves to go unloved or unsupported because of their sexuality. [Applause] This is a real issue for fathers, especially in the Black community. So yes, I will call my gay son back. I’ll be like, “Come here, n*gga. Come here. Come here. Just him please. Thanks, Sasquatch.” I’ll be like, “Look, I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.” It’s just that, you know, this whole gay thing just crept up on me from behind. Not behind like, ‘Oh!’ You know what I mean? You know, it’s just that, you know, I’m just having a hard time trying to swallow it. Not swallow it like [gagging] Okay, it’s just that, when you was little, I-I-I was like, ‘Hey, I got a son, and we gonna play ball together! Yay!’ And I didn’t know you wanted to play with dudes, so that’s kinda fucking me up. But let me ask you something. Are you happy? No, are you really happy? And this is your life? Then fuck it, I’m happy for you. And I accept you. You’re my son. Come here, boy, I love you. I’m proud of you. Come here. Give me a hug, come here. Put your arms around me. Stop being gay. Put your arms around me. I love you, boy. [Smooches] Alright. Go ahead, n*gga, go enjoy your prom night. “Yeah, you look pretty in your dress, okay?” Just do me a favor. For your dad. From n*gga… to n*ggette. Just don’t be no b*tch-ass n*gga. You fuck that n*gga in his ass. Yeah! You give him the Wayans stroke! Yeah, boy! Yeah! Yeah, boy! Yeah, boy! Yeah! [Speaks indistinctly] I got a son. He ain’t gay, but he’s an asshole. I don’t know what happens to kids when they become teenagers. They just turn into dickheads. My son’s a dickhead. Like, you know, when he was little, when he was 4 years old, that boy worshipped the ground I walked on. I couldn’t go anywhere without him following me around or crying. I would leave the house for one minute, this boy would lose his mind. [Crying] “I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my daddy! No, get off me, Mom! I don’t want you, I want Dad!” [Normal voice] And I’d come back in the house, I’d be like, “Hey, son! I’m home!” He’d go, “Dad!” and he would run to me, and he’d grab my leg and go, “Dad, you my best friend. Don’t ever leave again. Don’t ever leave again.” And I’d say, “Aw, there, there, little n*gga. [Chuckles] I just went to the store, man. Get the fuck up off me.” That’s when my son was 4 years old. My son is 18 years old now. Boy, does times change. I was gone for three and a half months. Three and a half months. I would call my son. Shit go right to voicemail. So I text his little ass. He didn’t text me back. No bubbles, no nothing. He wasn’t even attempting to hit me back. So I FaceTime his ass. Shit said “Unavailable.” Just a picture of me looking stupid like… So I hit him on Facebook. You know he unfriended me? So I dipped into his Instagram. This motherfucker unfollowed me. But he still follows Chaz0135. So now at this point, I’m like, “What’s this dude’s problem?” And I started getting mad, but then I started thinking, “Well, maybe he just misses me, and he don’t know how to express that.” But you know what? When I come home after three and a half months, he’s gonna come running to me like he did when he was little. He’s gonna grab my leg and say, “Dad, don’t ever leave again. Don’t ever leave again.” And, boy, was I wrong. I came in the house after three and a half months. I was so cocky. I walked in, I dropped my bags, I said, “Son! Daddy’s home!” This jackass looked at me, he said, [Sniffs] “What up, n*gga?” And then he walked away. I said, “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, n*gga”, if you don’t get the fuck over here and give me the proper greeting, a hug and a kiss, I swear to God, I will shove you back in my dick, “and I will shoot you into a sock!” Yeah, you better consider yourself lucky you here. It’s ’cause of me. It’s ’cause of my shot. ‘Cause, boy, I coulda shot you anywhere. I coulda shot you on a wall, I coulda shot you on the ceiling. I could reach! I just gotta hold it and then, bow! I coulda shot you in the sink, right down the drain. I coulda back-handed you or shot you in your mama’s hair. I coulda shot you in her face, ’cause your mama like that type of shit, son. And it’s not that I’m upset. It’s that I’m hurt. Father’s Day come. The one fucking day that fathers get to be loved and appreciated. My daughter, she posts a picture of me, she writes me nine measly words. “Happy Father’s Day, Dad. You a good dude.” I said, “No, little gay b*tch. You a good dude.” But I gotta give it to her. At least she gave me some effort. She wrote words. My son, this little dickhead, he writes me three letters. #HFD. Y’all, I was so confused, I was like, “Houston Fire Department, what the fuck?” [Chuckles] It took me to Christmas to realize this jackass was saying “Happy Father’s Day.” And I don’t know what I did wrong. ‘Cause when you parent, there’s no proper formula. But I know I left one important ingredient out.',\n",
       "  ' I… didn’t spank my children. Um, all the sisters like, “Oh, you did what?” Send them motherfuckers to my house. I got you, boo. I’ll beat they ass and send them right back to you. No, I wo… I’ll put cocoa butter on they little scars “and send them right fucking back.” Spanking’s just some shit that we inherited from slavery. And all we doing is passing that damage down to our own children. White folks don’t do that. They talk to their kids. You see little kids in the supermarket throwing shit and shitting in fucking cereal boxes and… [Mock White voice] “Stop that, Jimmy. Jimmy, no, that’s not nice. You’re making me anxious, Jimmy.” [Normal voice] Nig? Black folks’ kid grab a cereal box, “I’ll kill ya, n*gga! Bap bap!” We gotta stop that shit, y’all. That’s some bullshit. And I remember the day that I was at that crossroad where I was gonna spank – where I… I… I chose not to spank my son or my kids. So, my son was 4 years old, and he had one of his buddies over at the house. Little badass kid. Little n*gga, name was like Tyrese or Tyrell. I think anything with a “Ty” in it… Tyrese, Tyrell, Ty-Ty, Tyrone, he gonna spend time in juvie at some point in his life. He a bad little n*gga. He had the cornrows, little tattoo on his neck and shit. And my son, they were… He playing… They were playing ball in the house. Boppity-boppity-boppity-bah. And you know, my children’s mother, she got all upset. She started nagging. “Shawn, stop playing ball in the house!” And you know kids, they don’t listen to their mother. Like, “Yeah, whatever, b*tch.” Boppity-boppity-boppity-bah. So she calls me in. “Marlon, I told Shawn to stop playing ball in the house and he ain’t listening!” So, you know, I hit him with the daddy voice. I said, [Deep voice] “Hey, hey, hey!” [Normal voice] Every n*gga with a father just… That’s what my son did. I said, [Deep voice] “Hey, hey, hey! Your mama says stop playing ball in the house, you stop playing ball in the house, you understand me?” [Normal voice] My son said, “Okay.” And then Tyrese, this little fatherless motherfucker. I say that ’cause he was immune to daddy voice. So I squeezed one of my balls to get the ball… To get the voice a little deeper. I said, [Deeper voice] “Hey, n*gga, I don’t care if I’m your daddy or not, you better stop playing ball in the Goddamn house before I kick your little ass.” [Normal voice] He said, “Man, you ain’t my daddy.” I said, “I see why your daddy left you, you little piece of shit.” And so he’s still dribbling the ball. I told my son, “Hey, you better not play.” He can do what the fuck he want, but you? You better listen to me.” My son said, “Okay.” So Tyrese is dribbling the ball. Bobbity-bobbity-bobbity-bop. Bobbity-bop. He crossing over. Bobbity-bop. Bobbity-bop. Through the legs. Bop-bop-bop. And he doing behind-the-back drills. Bop-bop. He playing ball so good, this shit looked fun. I want the n*gga to pass me the ball. So, at a point, my son looking at Tyrese, and he’s all impressed, and then he look at me. And he’d look back at Tyrese dribbling the ball. And he’d look at me. And he’d look at Tyrese dribbling the ball, and he’d look at Tyrese, he’d go, “Hey, Tyrese! Pass me the ball!” Man, I got so mad, I forgot my son was my son. Matter of fact, I forgot he was a kid, period. I talked to him like he was a grown-ass man. I said, “Man, are you out your motherfucking mind!” You know who the fuck I am, n*gga? You don’t know me, n*gga! Oh, fuck, I’ll fuck you up, boy! I’ll fuck you up! You don’t know me! You don’t know me, n*gga! My mama don’t know me, and I came out of her. You know who you fucking with? “I’ll fucking chuck your little ass!” And his mother ran to him, she said, “Marlon, what you doing?” I said, “B*tch, this your fault!” She said, “Put him down.” So I put his little ass down. She said, “What’s wrong with you?” I said, “I don’t know!” So she grabbed me, brought me to the bathroom. And I came out the door, said, “I’ma fuck you up, Shawn! And Tyrese, I’m fucking you up, too!” And that’s when Tyrese pulled out his knife, he said, “Yeah, n*gga, come on with it. Come on with it.” So Angela grabs me into the bathroom. And at this point, I’m fucking crying and I’m shaking. And she’s like, “What’s wrong with you?” I was like, “I don’t fucking know!” And I look in the mirror. And then my face morphs to me as a little boy. And I started thinking about all the ass-whoopings that my father gave me. And I started thinking about how much those ass-whoopings hurt. Not just my heart, but my ass. And I started thinking that every time my father hit me, it only made me further away from him. It made me distant from my father. I love my father now as a man, but as a kid, I didn’t love him. I feared him. Every time my father called my name… “Marlon!” Yo, my heart would beat fast, I’d piss my leg a little bit. My leg would get itchy, my ass would get small. My booty hole get nervous. Booty hole be looking over. [Silly voice] Oh, shit, you in trouble now. [Normal voice] And it got to the point where sometimes it wasn’t even for a spanking. For good shit, I’d get scared! “Marlon!” Ha! [Sobs] “Here, take this, go get some ice cre',\n",
       "  'am.” “Oh, my God, what kind of fucking mind trick is this?” Because what parents don’t realize, especially a father, you are your child’s superhero. So every time you hit your kid, it’s like Spider-Man made a web that was a belt and whooped his little ass. Like Superman took off his cape and made one of them little towels that you hit n*ggas in the ass in the locker room. Sh-pap! Sh-pap! That’s what it feels like! And so I chose not to hit my son. Instead, I sent him to bed. I said, “Go to bed! And don’t eat! Ever! N*gga, you better not ever eat again!” So 4:00 in the morning, I woke his little ass up. I said, “Shawn!” He got up all scared. I could hear his heartbeat. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. I could see a little pee dribbling down his leg. His little ass got tight. His little booty hole started talking to me. [Silly voice] Oh, shit, you in trouble now! [Normal voice] And my boy started crying, he said, “You gonna spank me? You just gonna spank me, Dad? You gonna spank me? I don’t care, you can spank me! I don’t care! You can spank me!” I said, “I ain’t gonna spank you.” Said, “I’ma talk to you.” And I sat him down. I said, “Let me tell you something. What you did yesterday…” I said, “You hurt my feelings.” And my son started crying, he said, “Oh, God, Dad. Don’t say that. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, Dad.” I said, “You broke the trust.” He said, “Oh, God, no!” Say it ain’t so! Say it ain’t so! [Sobs] I didn’t mean to break the trust, Dad. Not the trust! What’s trust? How much is it? “Can Mom buy some more trust on Amazon?” I said, “You disappointed me.” He said, “Oh, Dad, I didn’t mean [sobs] to ussapoint… you!” And I said to myself, “Oh, shit. White power words work!” So I started hitting him with all kind of White power words. I said, “Yes, and furthermore!” “No, Dad, don’t go no further!” “I… I… I’m appalled.” “No, Dad, don’t call Paul!” “And I’m exacerbated by your action!” “Oh, Dad, don’t masturbate on the actions!” I said, “So why would you listen to Tyrese over me?” He said, “I don’t know, Dad.” He said, “Shit, ’cause I was scared, Dad! I was scared!” I said, “Why? Of what?” He says, “Of Tyrese.” I said, “Why?” He said, “Dad, he got a outie belly button!” [Laughter] And you know what’s funny, man? Is I wanna blame my kids for our relationship, but that would be wrong of me, and that’d be immature. As a man, I gotta blame myself. I fucked up. Somewhere along the line, I fucked up. And I’ve been trying to trace my steps, like, “What did I do?” Did I spoil them? I knew I shouldn’t have never told them n*ggas I had money. I should have raised them in the projects. “They need more government cheese in their life.” [Chuckles] Or was it because I got caught cheating on their mother on a boat in St. Bart’s? I don’t think that’s it. I think it was spoiling them, I definitely think. I fucked up, man. I did. And I’ll tell y’all a story. Fuck it, you know? What had happened was… [Laughs] That’s how you know it was bad, when you, “Well, what had happened was…” Alright, uh, shit. Alright. Real talk. Alright, so years back, I did a movie called A Haunted House. And, yeah, it was really successful. Like this shit, I made it for a million dollars. It made like $100 million dollars worldwide. I made so much money, I felt like Jay-Z. I was like, “Yo, I’m going somewhere hot where there’s no mosquitos! Yeah!” I was like, “Yo, I’m going to St. Bart’s.” I’ma rent a yacht!” But see, Jay-Z is so smart, I see why this n*gga’s a billionaire. ‘Cause Jay-Z, he brings Beyoncé and them babies to St. Bart’s with him. Yeah, see, me, I fucked up. I brought a n*gga named Steve. I’m out in St. Bart’s, right? And I’m in the middle of the ocean. I don’t even know how paparazzi got my picture. We was in the middle of the fucking ocean with some girls on the boat. And I swear, paparazzi is sneaky. I was like, “Where the fuck were they?” Were they in a fucking dolphin, just…[Imitating dolphin] [Imitating camera shutter clicking] I didn’t know where they was! And so, I didn’t know until I got back to my hotel. I get back to my hotel, I’m feeling myself, got my shirt off, got the Coppertone tan. I’m like, “Yeah, we did that, Steve! Yeah, we did that.” And then my phone buzzed. [Makes buzzing sound] What the fuck is that? So I picked up the phone, and see, I put Google alerts on myself, ’cause as y’all see from this set, I say a lot of stupid shit, so I need to know the stupid shit I say, so I can call my publicist, so she can put the stupid shit I say, and say it was a lie, when it probably was the truth. [Laughs] I pick it up. “Paris Mail.” [French accent] “Marlon Wayans caught on the boat kissing the beautiful mademoiselle, or was this a mistress in St. Bart’s? Uh-oh!” [Normal voice] I put that phone down. I was like, “Oh, fuck! Fuck!” I was like, “Shit!” I was like, “Okay, Angie don’t know shit about France.” Okay, she don’t know shit about French at all. She calls Gucci ‘Gucky.’ She don’t know shit! She still think I bought her a ‘Channel’ bag for Christmas. Alright, so maybe I’ll go by the Louis ‘Vootton’ store and buy her a bag “just in case she does find out.” But I was like, “Alright, relax, relax.',\n",
       "  ' She don’t know no publications out the country. That’s some White shit.” So I put my phone down. Motherfucker buzzed again. [Makes buzzing noise] I pick it up. N*gga. “Bossip.” “Media Take Out.” “Shade Room.” “Essence” magazine. “Ebony” magazine. Everybody had the same title. “Marlon Wayans caught on boat in St. Bart’s, cheating on his children’s mother with a White b*tch!” [Chuckles] And I don’t know if y’all know Black culture, but look, it’s one thing to fuck a… fuck around, but you fuck around with White girls, sisters don’t like that shit too much. That’s why we be lying. N*ggas be like, “Oh, she wasn’t… she wasn’t White. She was mixed. Yeah, she was Swedish and Irish and German, but she wasn’t White, you know what I mean?” And sisters, you should have seen the articles. They was lighting me up. They was like, “I can’t believe this funny-looking n*gga had the nerve to cheat. I could see if it was Shawn, but not this bird-looking n*gga. He look like a ostrich that fell in some fucking oil. I can see if it was Damon, at least he’s funny. I wanna sit on his smushed-up face. But Marlon? He got some fucking nerve. Him and Nick Cannon need to go crawl “under the same rock and die.” I was like, “Oh, shit!” They’re like, “I can’t believe he got caught cheating with a White b*tch,” and I’m like, “Okay, sisters, if she was Black, would y’all be happier about that?” Like you pick up the thing and you see, “Oh, my God, I can’t believe Marlon Wayans got caught cheating. [Gasps] With a Black b*tch! That’s why I fucks with Marlon. I always like Marlon the best! “I did. He got big dick swag.” And so now, I start getting the phone calls. Paparazzi took so many pictures of me, my brothers find out shit about me they didn’t know I did. Phone rings. Keenen. [As Keenen] “Now, what’s up, little boy? How you doing? Mm, looks like you’re having a bad day. And when did you learn how to scuba dive?” [Normal voice] Hang up on him. Shawn. [As Shawn] “Hey, stupid! What are you doing, stupid?” What are you doing in the fucking ocean? You fucking drowned in a bathtub when we was fucking 8 years old, you fucking stupid. When did you learn how to Jet Ski? You crashed your fucking Big Wheel three times. “Why would you get a fucking Jet Ski, stupid?” [Normal voice] He hangs up the phone. Damon. [As Damon] “Hey, ugly, how you doing?” Mm. I’m doing better than you, that’s for sure. Hey, let me ask you something. When did you learn how to snorkel? “Mm-mm-mm.” [Normal voice] So then my children’s mother. [As Angie’s] “You stupid motherfucker. I can’t believe you got caught cheating! Can’t you be more discreet?” [Normal voice] I said, “Baby”, I was in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, 8,500 miles away. You gotta know the latitude and longitude of my dick “to catch me.” “Well, they caught your stupid ass. And look at you looking all stupid.” Women are funny. ‘Cause it wasn’t the kiss that she was mad about. She found the little shit. I said, “I know, I can’t believe I was sitting there kissing that girl, I’m so… I know it’s so embarrassing.” She said, “I don’t give a fuck about that little, pasty”, little b*tch with her little, thin-ass bologna lips, that scraggly-looking b*tch. Look at your stupid foot. Look at your stupid little foot. Look at that shit all pigeon-toed, bird foot motherfucker, looking like a old son… A fucking parrot twisted his ankle. Look how stupid your fucking foot look up in the air, “looking all stupid.” [Chuckles] She had me looking like, “Oh, shit, I am pigeon-toed. Ain’t that a b*tch.” And she goes, “I can’t believe you got caught cheating with a White b*tch!” I said, “Ang, she wasn’t White. She was mixed. She was Swedish and Irish and German, and… and I think she might have had been a little bit Nazi, but she wasn’t White, like, you’re tripping.” She hangs up the phone. Then my buddy Steve, he comes to the rescue. [As Steve] “Marlon, listen.” [Scoffs] All she got was pictures. Pictures are worth a thousand words. All you have to do is corroborate a story. We don’t know what happened in that picture. So here’s the story we’re gonna tell. We went in the middle of the ocean, and… and… and we went in a yacht, “and we saw some mermaids.” “And the mermaids was drowning.” Bloop-bloop-bloop. Bloop-bloop-bloop. And you, being the good Samaritan that you are, you jumped overboard, being a hero. You grabbed the mermaid to safety, and you brought her on board. And you wasn’t kissing her! No. No, no, no. “You was giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.” [Normal voice] I said, “N*gga, if you don’t get the fuck away” from me, I swear to God, I will wrap this anchor around your neck and put you in the bottom of this fucking ocean, “so help me God.” So now, I gotta go home, and I gotta face the music. And see, that day was the worst day of my life. That’s some shit that I’m gonna regret till my dying day. I’m gonna be in the coffin. They gonna close the lid, I’m like, “I’m sorry about the boat!” Because it’s one thing to break your woman’s heart. It’s another thing to break your kid’s heart. And I remember, I went to her house. I stop at my house, and I grab my Bible. Yeah, ’cause it’s really hard t',\n",
       "  \"o throw hot grits on a n*gga holding a Bible. And I walk up to the door, and I knock on the door. And she sees me holding the Bible, I said, “Bible study, my sister.” And she starts to laugh, because, you know, I… That’s the thing that she fell in love with. The fact that I have humor. I ain’t cute, so it’s definitely the humor. And she was like, “Don’t make me laugh.” Don’t… I fucking hate you. Don’t make me… Is that really a Bibl… Fuck it, I hate you. Don’t make me laugh!” And she hit me. I said, “Um, sister, it says ‘Thou shalt not kill.'” And she said, “Yeah, and it also says, ‘Thou shalt not fuck White b*tches in St. Bart’s.'” I said, “She wasn’t White. She was mixed.” [Laughs] And she’s like, “Get your ass in there.” And then [chuckles] she goes, “Go ahead. Talk to your kids.” I said, “Talk to the kids?” “Yeah, tell them what you did.” “Tell them what you did?” Fuck it. You got a page out the book “The Mack”? What the fuck? Stick yourself, Tony. Stick yourself. So she said, “No, talk to them.” I look at the table, and my kids are sitting at the table. My son, he looked like… He’s so sad, he looks like his pet turtle died. And my daughter, she’s sitting there holding her little naked dollies, just [humming] I said, “Hey, kids, how you doing?” Um, remember when Daddy said he wasn’t perfect? Well, there’s something on the Internet that proves that theory, so whatever you do, “don’t Google my name.” My daughter said, “Too late, Dad. Hmm. Can’t believe you got caught cheating on Mom. [Chuckles] With a White b*tch.” I said, “She wasn’t White. She was mixed! She was Swedish and Irish and German, and a little bit Aryan, but I don’t… I don’t think she was White.” And she goes, “Don’t worry, Dad. I accept you.” I said, “You do?” I said, “You forgive me?” She goes, “Yeah, I forgive you. And I accept you. But, you know, there’s gonna be some things you’re gonna have to accept about me, too, later on in life.” And she took her two little white dollies and put they pussies together. And I was like, “Okay.” And so, I said to my son, I said, “Son, do you forgive me?” He said, “Yeah, I forgive you, Dad.” But I’m really ussapointed. And furthermore, I think you should call Paul. And I need you to really masturbate on your actions, “’cause sh…” And I said, “I think I know what you mean. I’m sorry.” I said, “I love you, and I’ma make it up to you guys.” I promise. If I gotta spend the rest of my life making it up to you, I will. “And I love you.” And I gave them both kisses. [Smooches] And they said, “Okay.” And I went to walk off, and I was like, “Oh, thank God.” And my son said, “Hey, Dad?” I said, “Huh?” Said, “I got a few more questions.” I said, “You do? Okay, shoot, Tiger, what… What you got? You wanna know the weather in St. Bart’s? It’s hot, humid, you know, no mosquitos. It’s cool.” He said, “Mnh-mnh.” He said, “How many girls was on the boat?” Where did you meet these girls? How did they get there? Did you know them all? That one you was kissing, how do you know her? Where do you know her from? Did you fly her in? Did she fly first class? Did she fly coach? Or was she Delta Comfort? What’s this girl’s Instagram? “What’s her number? Do you love her?” I said, “Hey, n*gga, where you get these fucking questions from?” And I look over at his mother, who got a whole list of questions, and she’s checking them off. “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And don’t forget to ask if he wore a condom.” I said, “You wanna know the truth?” Fuck it. You wanna know the truth? I’ma tell you the fucking truth. Here’s the truth. The movie was very successful. I made a lot of fucking money, and I wanted to go somewhere hot where there was no mosquitos, so I went to St. Bart’s. And me and my boy rented a boat, and we went out to the middle of the ocean. And we saw some mermaids, “and they were drowning.” [Laughs] No, but re… [chuckles] real talk? You know, you gotta understand, fame is hard, man. I’ve been doing this shit for 30 years. And temptation is fucking real, man. Like, I could say “No” to a thousand girls. But, man, a thousand and one, sometimes they come with a thousand and two. And then they bring a thousand and three and four and… [Deep voice] You know what it is.

       " ['Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. The, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just',\n",
       "  ' don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just… This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.” I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I w',\n",
       "  'as like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good. So… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some',\n",
       "  ' kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.” As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full h',\n",
       "  'ouse? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.” So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.” The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I',\n",
       "  '’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.” You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!” So we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all',\n",
       "  ' see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.” So… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.',\n",
       "  '” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.” So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.” At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, ',\n",
       "  'I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was c',\n",
       "  'learly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.

       " ['Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is packed with Gervais‘ signature brand of sharp, often controversial humor, tackling topics like artificial intelligence, political correctness, family weddings, funerals, and, as the title suggests, the end of humanity. It’s a show for fans of his biting humor and willingness to push boundaries. If you’re easily offended or prefer more gentle comedy, it might not be your cup of tea. However, if you appreciate Gervais’ brand of dark humor and insightful observations, you’re likely to find plenty to laugh at, even if you cringe at times. Ricky Gervais: Armageddon is streaming on Netflix from December 25, 2023 * * * [audience chattering] [audience cheering and whistling] Hello. Thank you. [clears throat] Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thank you. [man 1] Whoo! No. Shh. That’s… You’ve… Thank you. [man 1 yells] No, you know the score. [man 1 yells] Shut the fuck up. [audience laughing] Thank you. Welcome to my new show. So new, in fact, it’s still evolving. I’ve got bits tonight I haven’t done before, right? [audience cheering] If I ad-lib, I haven’t even thought it before. And I have some terrible fucking thoughts. [audience laughing] But you can’t help that, can you? You can’t choose your thoughts. They just appear. It’s too late. You have a thought, and it goes, “I’m a thought.” And you go, “Oh fuck, I thought that.” [audience laughing] And then, sometimes, the thought will go, “Now say it.” [audience laughing] And I say it, and… Netflix. [audience laughing] My last show, SuperNature, dropped on Netflix last year. Um, big backlash, wasn’t there? [audience cheering] Big… Oh, big backlash. People going, “You can’t say that.” You can. You can. [audience laughing] I did. Um… [audience cheering and whistling] Yeah, the inevitable backlash, which made it the most-watched special of the year, so… [audience laughing] I’ve learned my lesson. Um… [audience laughing] No, I have learned my lesson, and that’s why I’m going to be woke from now on. [audience laughing and booing] It’s about time. Well, I’m sorry. Well, I am woke. And now I’m woke, the first thing I’ve gotta do is change my Twitter bio. ‘Cause at the moment, it’s, like, a list of the shows I’ve created. But now I’m woke, I’ve gotta pop in the word “anti-fascist”… [audience laughing] …so people know I’m not a fascist, ’cause that is a big problem at the moment. Um… People come up to you and go, “Rick, have you been imprisoning journalists?” I go, “No.” They go, “Oh, interesting.” [audience laughing] They go, “Have you been gassing Jews?” I go, “No.” They go, “Pop it in your bio then, you silly cunt.” [audience laughing] [scattered applause] So, yeah, I’m not a fascist. It’s an odd thing to declare, isn’t it, that you’re not a fascist? We assume, don’t we? You wouldn’t go up to someone in the street and do that, would you? “Oh, by the way, I’m not a fascist.” You know? [audience laughing] It’s like they protest too much. It’s like going into a school and going, “I’m not a pedo.” “So just forget I even mentioned it.” [audience laughing] “These kids are safe running around me. Don’t worry.” [laughs] “They can run around naked for all I care.” “I’m not a pedo, so…” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “fascist” has changed. Traditionally, the word “fascist” meant a member of a far-right authoritarian regime that uses militarism and violence to suppress individual rights. Now the word “fascist” can mean “liked a Joe Rogan tweet.” So… [audience laughing] …words change, yeah? And that’s part of the reason I’m gonna become woke. Words change, and I don’t wanna be left behind, you know. I don’t wanna end up like my granddad in the ’70s. Oh. He was all like, “coloreds” this and “queers” that. [groans] Although the word “queer” is all right again now, so… If you wait long enough, it just goes full circle. Just… [audience laughing] Just be patient is my ad… [audience laughing] So, yeah, you can… you can use the word “queer” now. You still can’t use it as a noun, only as an adjective. You can’t go up to someone and go, “You’re a queer,” but you can go, “Hear about Darren? He’s queer now.” [audience laughing] If Darren is definitely bent. [audience laughing] You can’t go around just slagging off Darren willy-nilly. Do you know what I mean? You can… You can get sued in this country for saying someone’s gay if they’re not, you know, which is a homophobic law, ’cause you can’t be sued the other way around. You can’t be sued for saying someone’s not gay if they are, which seems unfair, doesn’t it? Like, I could go up to Britain’s biggest gay and go, “All right, Elton.” All right? And… [audience laughing] He’d love that. He’d fucking love that. If that’s your game, you wanna be top of the pile, so to speak. Right? [laughs] [audience laughing] I’d go, “All right, Elton?” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, ♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪\\n♪ Ha-ha You’re not a gay ♪ [audience laughing] He’d go, “I bloody am.” All right? He’d go, “I’m gonna sue you.” I’d go, “You can’t. You can’t.” [audience laughing] He’d go, “But know that I am gay.” I go, “I don’t believe you are.” He’d go, “Come home with me and see the shit I do if you don’t believe me.” [audience laughing] Of course, the word “queer” has changed. Again, traditionally, the word “queer” used to mean uh, someone who was attracted to the same sex as themselves. A gay man, all right? Now, the word “queer” can mean a straight man who wants some attention. [audience laughing] “I’m all queer. I’m all queer now.” “Are you?” “Yeah, I’m ri… I’m…” “I’m right queer now, I am.” [audience laughing] “Are you?” “Yeah.” “What about your girlfriend?” “Yeah, she’s queer and all. We’re just…” [audience laughing] “We’re just two queers queering each other up.” [audience laughing] “Suck a cock.” “Nah.” [audience laughing] “No, didn’t think so.” “I’m not that sort of queer.” [groans] “What sort of a queer are you?” “Dyed my hair blue.” [audience laughing] “So did my grandmother and she fucking loved cock.” “So, what… What are we saying?” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping and cheering] I have no ev',\n",
       "  \"idence for that. [audience laughing] We… We never had that conversation. [man 2 yells] [Gervais laughs] So words change is my point. Like the word “handicapped.” All right? Again, traditionally, that was the politically correct term, the all-inclusive term for cripples and shit, right? Uh… [audience laughing] But then, they went, “No, we wanna be disabled.” They didn’t wanna be disabled. They said… [audience laughing] [laughs] They said… They said… [laughs] They said, “We wanna be referred to as ‘disabled.'” “We don’t like the term ‘handicapped’ anymore.” “Stop using it. Say ‘disabled.'” We went, “Fine.” And that’s great. Just tell me the rules and I’ll… In fact, I’m a stickler for the rules. Like, if I was on a beach and a woman came running and went, “Help! Help! My handicapped toddler’s drowning!” I’d go, “Sorry your what, love? What?” [audience laughing] “My handicapped toddler’s drowning, and he can’t swim.” “Whoa. Do you mean your disabled toddler is drowning?” “Yeah.” I go, “Right. Well, let’s… Oh, dead.” [audience laughing] Dead. Wasted too much time being woke, didn’t I? [audience laughing] Well, I am woke now, and I can prove it. Here you go. I love illegal immigrants. Yeah, sue me. Sometimes I go down to Dover for the day, right? And I… I look out, right? I look out. I look for a boat, and I see a dinghy with about 60 of ’em. And I go, “Over here.” Like that, right? [audience laughing] And I pull ’em in. I pull ’em into shore. And I go, “Women and children first.” They go, “There are no women and chil…” “Just you lads, is it? Come on, lads.” [audience laughing and clapping] [woman 1] Whoo! If I go down there and there’s no boat, I am absolutely fucking gutted. I don’t… [audience laughing] I just sort of wander into town, and, uh, I stand by the traffic lights, and I wait for a big lorry to pull up, right? And I look underneath, and there’s a lad sort of clutching like that. And I go, “Where you headed?” He goes, “Gary Lineker’s house.” I go, “It’s just down there.” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Yeah. Fuck borders. Fuck… We don’t need borders, do we? Be like the Vikings. They didn’t care about borders, did they? I’ve got a little bit of Viking blood in me. Well, we all have, ’cause of all the raping they did. [audience laughing] They say it was raping and pillaging, but I think it was mainly for the raping. I think they added the pillaging bit for the wives. Know what I mean? They went down and went, “We’re off to Great Britain.” “Oh, why?” “Just a bit of pillaging.” [audience laughing] “Just pillaging?” “Just pillaging, babe.” [audience laughing] “All right. Why are you wearing your rape hat?” [audience laughing] So this show is called Armageddon, and it’s all about how I think humanity might end, ’cause there’s a long list of possibilities, you know? We’re on a precipice, you know. Um, it could be, uh, anything from global warming, the rise of the… the pandemic, you know. Um, nuclear war, our own stupidity, basically. ‘Cause we are getting more stupid as a species. No doubt about that. You can now do a university degree course in Taylor Swift. How fucking low, academically, can you go? There’s an institute in London called the School of Flower Arranging. I went past it. I couldn’t believe it. “School of Flower Arra…” I looked in, and there’s people having lectures. Flower arranging! My mum used to pick flowers every day from the garden, cut flowers, put ’em in vases around the house. At no point did anyone come around and go, “What unqualified cunt did these?” [audience laughing] Uh, yeah, the Earth is in a terrible mess, and it’s my fault. My generation’s fault. And the generation before, the Boomers, with their deforestation and their fossil fuels, ruining the ozone layer, raising the temperature by a few degrees. So parasites, you know, bacteria, and the zootrophic pandemics are just gonna get worse and worse. Like, if you’re 20 years old now, you’re gonna have a very different middle age to me. I’ve had the best 60 years of civilization. But if you’re 20 now, in 40 years’ time, you’re gonna be in your house, wearing a mask… crying. [audience laughing] Like you do now over jokes. [audience laughing] [audience clapping and cheering] And I’m not gonna be around to see that, but I am gonna spend my entire fortune, from now on, on private jets to make sure it definitely fucking happens. [audience laughing] [woman 2] Whoo! [man 3] Yeah, Ricky! We’re gonna be the first generation that future generations are jealous of, right? ‘Cause we had it all, and we’re using it all up. We’re using up all the fresh water. We’re using up all the fossil fuel. Usually, you look back in history and you feel sorry. You go, “Oh, how did they live like that? Oh, how did they get around?” “No indoor toilets.” I’ve got nine toilets in my house. [audience laughing] Um… And sometimes, I just run around flushing ’em for a laugh. Like that. [audience laughing] Just so that in 40 years’ time, Greta Thunberg has to shit out of a window. [audience laughing] I’ve got 28 radiators. I always have them on full. Then I put the air con on full, and it sort of settles at about 20 degrees. A lovely… It’s how the cat likes it. She loves it at 20 degrees. And I… I spoil my cat. Um… I love cats. I love having a cat. Thing about… Cats are great, but if you let ’em out, they bring home the most disgusting things. Last week, mine brought home a Scouser with herpes. [audience laughing] And it wasn’t quite dead, so I had to get it by its legs and crack its head against the table. [audience laughing] Ugh. [clicks tongue] And who cares? If humanity was wiped out today, the Earth would return to a paradise in a few hundred years. If we lose bees, we’re a desert, forever. We’re not that important. We’re just one species of narcissistic ape. And some people on social media get annoyed when I say we’re apes. You know, religious types, Americans. Um… [audience laughing] One bloke said to me, “Speak for yourself, dude. I ain’t no ape.” And I sent back, “Well, you are, ’cause we’re all apes.” He went, “Nah. What’s a gor\",\n",
       "  'illa ever done?” “We’ve walked on the moon.” I sent back, “What do you mean, ‘we’? You’ve done fuck all.” [audience laughing] “You’ve spelled ‘moon’ wrong.” [audience laughing] It’s weird, isn’t it, when people take credit for the sort of rest of the species. ‘Cause that’s what’s pushed civilization forward, you know, a few geniuses along the way. Like, there’s eight billion people on this planet. Most of us do nothing. We eat, shit, and die. Like, if there was a meteor heading towards Earth that’d definitely destroy it, four billion people would get down on their knees and pray to their particular god, and a few hundred scientists would work out how to get Bruce Willis up there to stop it. [audience laughing] It’s an odd concept, praying, for me. I can’t work out how God decides. All those people praying at once for different things. Is it like best idea wins, or is it a democracy? Like, he puts things… Each issue, he goes, “Right, votes for and against,” you know. If it’s a democracy, we’re in trouble. We’re a tiny nation. Like, next time there’s a flood warning in the West Country, if we’re all going, “Oh, I hope everyone’s okay,” if the whole of China is going, “Yeah, fuck Bristol…” [audience laughing] There’s a billion of them. Know what I mean? More about China later. [audience laughing] Yeah, I’ve always, uh, found praying quite strange. Like, if I bump into a friend or neighbor, and I know they’ve got a little kid, and I go, “Oh, how’s so-and-so?” And they go, “Oh, not good. Um, he’s in intensive care.” “We don’t know if he’s gonna pull through, but I pray every night.” What I do as an experiment… [inhales sharply] [audience laughing] I go home, and I pray twice that he doesn’t make it. [audience laughing] [man 4] Oh… I don’t do that. [audience laughing] On a serious note, um, I’ve been doing a lot of video messages recently for terminally-ill children. And, um… Only if they request it, obviously. I don’t… [audience laughing] I don’t burst into hospitals and go, “Wake up, baldy.” [audience laughing] “Look, me twerking on TikTok. Look.” [audience laughing] No, um, I did a lot through the pandemic. Presumably, ’cause they couldn’t even see their own family. And, uh… It’s through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Do you know the charity? They’re great, and they give these dying kids their one wish. And if it’s me, I always say yes, and I always start the video the same way. I go, “Why didn’t you wish to get better?” [audience laughing] “What, you fucking retarded as well?” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughs] I don’t do that either, okay? [audience laughing] These are all jokes, okay? [laughs] In fact, I don’t even use that word in real life, the r-word. “You just used it.” “Yeah, in a joke.” “That’s not real life, is it? I’m playing a role.” “You sounded pretty convincing.” “Yeah, ’cause I’m good.” [audience laughing] You wouldn’t level the accusation at other art forms. You wouldn’t go up to Sir Anthony Hopkins and go, “I saw you in Silence of the Lambs.” “What, so, you a cannibal, are you?” “No, I… I was playing a role.” “Oh.” “Mm, seemed pretty convincing.” Yeah. [audience laughing] He’s good, and I’m good, and that’s why I do things well. Imagine if I came out and did things not very well, so you knew I was joking. That’d be fucking retarded. [audience laughing] Has anyone bothered asking the dolphins if they mind swimming with dying kids? Know what I mean? ‘Cause that can’t be fun for… They’re, like, flipping around, then suddenly someone dumps a truckload of pale teenagers flailing… [audience laughing] The dolphin’s like, “What the fuck is this? What the fuck’s this? Oh, fucking hell.” [groans] Oh, let him do it.” “What the fuck?” “They’re all… They’re all dying.” “Of what? That one just stuck his fingers in my fucking blowhole.” [audience laughing] “He’s not gonna be around for long.” “Nor am I if I can’t fucking breathe.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] It’s very sad, um, but we all die. We all know we’re gonna die, and we all do die, so it doesn’t really matter if we die one at a time along the way, or all at once, in one big final Armageddon. The result is, we’re all gonna be dead one day, and we’re all gonna be dead forever. And I’ve been to a lot of funerals in my time. You live this long, you know a lot of people, they die, right? And I don’t mind funerals, ’cause it’s the end. You know what I mean? I hate weddings. Oh, fucking… [audience laughing] It’s all… There’s so much hope. You know what I mean? And they’re needy and arrogant. They go, “Oh, we’re getting…” “Do you wanna come and watch us for 12 hours?” “No. Fuck, no.” [audience laughing] Even the invite is arrogant, isn’t it? It’s like a royal decree. “You are cordially invited…” It’s not a fucking honor. I don’t wanna go to your shitty wedding. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And then you go, “Oh, right, yeah. When is it?” They go, “Two years’ time.” They know you haven’t got an excuse for two years’ time. [audience laughing] So you just have to hope that one of ’em dies. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] And so you go, “Oh, yeah, I’ll be there. Yeah, yeah. Where is it?” They go, “India.” “Oh, fuck off!” [audience laughing] I’m not having injections for you, you boring bastards. [audience laughing] And I’ve got a big family now, a big extended family. There’s always one getting married. They know I’ve got a bit of cash. So I can’t give ’em a tea set anymore. I’ve gotta get ’em their first fucking house. Know what I mean? [audience laughing] I’ve got a big family. I had older brothers and sisters. They all had loads of kids, and their kids have loads of kids, and their kids have had loads of kids, ’cause we’re chavs, basically. [audience laughing] There’s a new baby every Christmas. It’s one of those families. I go home, it’s crowded. I go, “Oh. Oh, whose is that?” “Oh, yours. Well done.” I don’t know him, I don’t know her. You know what I mean? It’s like… But what I’ve done over the last couple of years, I’ve got ’em each and individually, right, in private, and I’ve told them that I’m leaving my e',\n",
       "  'ntire fortune to just them, right? [audience laughing] But to keep it secret. So they all love me, right? And I’m not doing a will, so my funeral is gonna be a fucking bloodbath. [audience laughing] I’m at that age now where people ask me what I’ve got planned for my funeral. Even journalists say, “How… What’s your funeral…” I go, “I haven’t planned it.” “No?” “No, it’s depressing.” “Also, I don’t care. I’ll be dead.” They go, “Don’t care about what people think of you?” “No, I’ll be dead.” They go, “What about your legacy?” “Fuck my legacy.” You can’t plan your legacy. I think of all these people who died thinking they’d be loved forever. Eminent people going, “There is a statue of me in the town square.” And now, they’re pulling down the statues. “Pull down this fucking statue.” “Why?” “He was a slave trader. Pull down the fucking statue.” “He built the hospital. Should we pull that down?” “No, leave the hospital.” [audience laughing] “Just pull down the fucking statue.” [audience cheering and whistling] “Pull down the statue and dump it in the canal.” “He built the canal.” “Doesn’t matter. Just pull down the fucking statue.” I don’t think you should whitewash history. If you find out summat new, add to it. Like, if there’s a statue, and it’s got, “Lord Whimsy. Trader, philanthropist.” Add, “a bit racist.” [audience laughing] Or one of those blue plaques on a house that goes, “Sir Robert Spewk lived here.” “Author, poet, pedo.” [audience laughing] I think we live too long. That’s why we have time to worry about all this. We’re not meant to live this long. Uh, as a species, we’re about 300,000 years old, as Homo sapiens. We’ve been around as hominids for a few million years, and, of course, along with every other life-form that exists at the moment, we’ve been evolving for three and a half billion years. Everything that exists at the moment all came from the same little blob of organic matter three and a half billion years ago. That’s why it annoys me when people say, “Oh, yeah, humans, we’re the most evolved.” We’re not the most evolved. We’re no more evolved than the slug or the snail. People go, “Come on, look at ’em.” Yeah, they got it right early doors. Nature keeps testing ’em. “Do you want eyes?” “No.” [audience laughing] “Not really. No. No.” I have noticed one thing about the slug and the snail. Let’s not split hairs. Let’s be honest. The snail is basically a slug with a shell on it, isn’t it? Right? But if you pull the shell off the snail, it starts giving it all… [groans] [audience laughing] “Oh, I’m dying. I’m dying.” And the slug is like, “Welcome to the real world, cunt.” Know what I mean? [audience laughing] So, yeah, we’ve been around for about 300,000 years. And for most of that time, we had the same life expectancy as every other wild ape. Thirty-five, 40, if you’re lucky. You’re born, you grow, you mate, you’re playing with your kids, you get a cut, you go, “What’s that?” Dead. [audience laughing] But now, with antibiotics and medicine, we’ve pushed that forward. A child born today can expect to live to about 100. And scientists said soon that’ll be about 120. And science also said that, in the near future, there’s no reason, with proper care and attention, that human beings won’t regularly live to 150 years old. Which is amazing, until you remember that we get a set number of brain cells, which we only lose. You can’t get them back. So, in the future, there’s gonna be 15 billion people on the planet. You know? Half of them are gonna be over 100, and they’re all gonna have Alzheimer’s. It’s gonna be like Dawn of the Dead. It’s gonna be fucking horrible. [audience laughing] You know? My auntie died of Alzheimer’s. Um, I don’t know how you die of Alzheimer’s. She forgot to live. Right? [audience laughing] And for the last couple of years, she was in a home, and, uh, my cousin, her only kid, used to visit her, like, once a week. And it got more and more depressing, ’cause soon she didn’t recognize him, and then she didn’t know who she was, or… and then she died. And at the funeral, we were sort of reminiscing about the good days. Some of the funny, absent-minded things she said and did. Then we realized, oh, probably, that was the beginning of the disease before it was diagnosed. And this is a true story. Once, my cousin went home from work, and he went in, and she went, “Your tea’s in the oven. I’ve had mine already.” He went, “Oh, cheers, Mum.” And he… It was like a fish pie, right? He ate the fish pie, then he went, “Oh God. Ooh.” He ran upstairs… [imitates retching] Vomited. Went back down and went, “Mum, the fish is off. I’ve just been really sick.” And she said, “Yeah, it made me really sick.” [audience laughing] I’ve been looking into infant mortality rates recently. Um… [audience murmuring] For research. Not… It’s not a fucking fetish. Like… [audience laughing] A child born today in the UK has a percentage chance of survival of 99.8%, which is incredible. I thought, “Is that just the mollycoddled West?” I was putting in Third World countries. And even in Africa, it’s like 96.5%. In the wilds of Africa, where everything wants to fucking eat a newborn baby. Babies are vulnerable enough, aren’t they? In Africa, a baby can be born in a mud hut. There’s a lion outside. It’s covered in blood. They can’t wash it. They’ve got no water. Ooh, and it’s already got AIDS. [audience laughing] Now… by the time that joke goes on Netflix… [audience laughing] …it’ll be nuanced. There’ll be an underlying satirical point, I’ll claim. [audience laughing] But, until then, all I’ve got is, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” [audience laughing] I know that it’s funny. I just have to work out why. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. Also, by the time that goes on Netflix, I’ll have been playing arenas around the world. It’ll be hitting hard. People will be laughing. So if you are an African woman, and you… you just had a baby in Africa, and the doctor goes, “Oh, I’m sorry, your baby’s got AIDS.” You go, “Oh my God.” You’re there… Baby’s got… You’re there with your husband, and you go, “',\n",
       "  'Our baby’s got AIDS, Jeff.” Jeff… [laughs] [audience laughing] [laughing] “I know, Tracy. I’ve got it too.” [imitates extinguishing cigarette] [audience laughing] [laughs] “Our baby’s got AIDS. Should we watch some comedy to cheer us up?” “Yeah. What, Netflix?” “Yeah.” “What, Ricky Gervais?” “Duh.” “Yeah.” [audience laughing] And they’re… they’re sad that their baby’s got AIDS, but they’re sort of laughing along. “Ha-ha. Armageddon. Ha-ha.” And it gets to that bit, “Ha, baby’s got AIDS.” And she goes, “Oh my God. Jeff, why… why are they all laughing at us and our baby with AIDS?” And Jeff goes, “Well, they’re not laughing at us per se.” She goes, “Well, they are. They’ve named us and everything.” “They’re literally laughing at us in this bit.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] And Jeff goes, “Yeah, but we’re a fictional couple with a fictional baby with AIDS.” “Anyone offended by that is a fucking moron.” [audience laughing] And then, he goes, “And at least he didn’t do the accent.” So… [audience laughing] And she goes, “Yeah, but only because Jane begged him not to.” [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] It’s funny ’cause it’s true. [audience clapping and cheering] I think we get our sense of humor from our parents, whether we realize it or not. Particularly working-class kids. Particularly from working-class mums. ‘Cause they’re busy. They’re doing everything. They’re keeping men in check, they’re bringing up kids, they’re going to work, they’re saving the world. They haven’t got time. They have to frighten their kids into behaving well. They have to go to dark places to shock them into not fucking dying. Do you know what I mean? So… Like, if I was little, and my mum made my tea, and it wasn’t my favorite, it was boiled potatoes, instead of chips every day, and I went, “I don’t like them,” my mum would go straight to, “Of course you do.” “There’s children your age in Africa and they’re starving to death.” Right? I’d go, “Jesus. All right.” You know what I mean? Ju… [snapping fingers] True story. I was seven years old, right, and I’d been playing in the park. And I came running in, and my mum went, “Ricky, come here. Sit down.” There must’ve been a local pedo incident, all right? [audience laughing] And my mum went, “Never go in the toilets in the park again.” And I went, “Why?” She knew she couldn’t explain pedophilia to a seven-year-old, right? But this is what she came up with. She said, “Because there’s a man going around, and he’s cutting little boys’ willies off.” [audience laughing] I was like… “What, that’s a fucking thing, is it? That’s a…” I didn’t sleep for a week. Uh… [audience laughing] And it worked. I never went in those fucking toilets again. But she knew, instinctively. If she’d gone, “Ricky, come in. Sit down.” “What’s the matter?” “Never go in the toilets again.” “Why not?” “There’s a pedophile.” “What’s a pedophile?” “Oh, he’s a man who gives you sweets and puppies.” “Bring it on!” You know what I mean? [audience laughing] Me… At seven years old? I’d wank off anyone for a puppy. [audience laughing] It’d be like that, wouldn’t it? It’d be like that. [audience laughing] I’m gonna get a puppy. [audience laughing] Hi. I’m getting a puppy. I’m getting a puppy. Gonna get a puppy. Oh, fucking hell. [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t… I cannot do it left-handed at all. [audience laughing] Fucking hell, come on. Have you been drinking? [audience laughing] Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on! [audience laughing] Fucking hell. Oh. [Gervais laughing] I’ve started, so I’ll finish. [Gervais laughing] [audience laughing] Oh. Oh, fuck me. Oh. What sort of puppy is it? [audience laughing] A what? A Labrador? [audience laughing] Throw in a kitten, and I’ll give you a blow job. [laughs] I go back. Kitten, puppy, cum. [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh… I miss the local pedo. [audience laughing] Don’t you? There was always one, wasn’t there? Outside school, you’d be with your mum, and she’d go, “Look, there’s a pedophile.” ‘Cause he had the uniform of the pedo. You know what I mean? You could spot… Old bloke, bald on top, long down the side. Like that. And I’ll go, “That’s a dirty p…” “Say hello.” “Hello.” Like that. Dirty look. That’s what a fucking pedo looks… Dirty fucking pedophile, right? That’s what he’d look… If he touches you, we’ll burn his house down. It was a good system. Know what I mean? But then Michael Jackson comes along, and he breaks the mold, doesn’t he? ‘Cause he’s… he’s not an ugly bloke outside the school. I’m not saying Michael Jackson definitely was a pedophile. No one knows. Only Michael and all those people he paid off. All I’m saying is… [audience laughing] [woman 3] Yes! …that kids loved Michael. They… Kids loved Michael just to look at him. Like a little Disney cartoon, wasn’t he? And then his voice, “Hello.” You know, that… [audience laughing] Oh. Michael Jackson would go up to any kid he wanted. Probably went up to them like that, didn’t he? Like that. [audience laughing] That’s another thing. Kids would go, “There’s Michael Jackson. He’s going away from us.” He wasn’t. He was going towards them. [audience laughing] But people don’t care, ’cause he’s so good. Right? He’s so good. He’s so popular as well. I think if he’d have lived to stand trial, he’d have beaten the rap, ’cause everyone loves him, and he’d be so vulnerable in court as well, wouldn’t he? He’d be there like that, and the judge would go, “Michael, did you fiddle with all those kids?” And he’d go, “Hee, hee.” [audience laughing] The judge would go, “Case di… Get out of here, you scamp. Go on.” [audience laughing] I promised you more about China, and this is, uh, an amazing statistic, okay? This is true. Look it up, right? In China, there are ten million Chinese pedophiles. Ten million Chinese pedophiles in China, and there’s not enough kids. ‘Cause they’ve been restricting the birth. There’s all these poor pedos and they’re going, “Where’s all the fucking kids?” You know? [audience laughing] “Fuck me.” [audience yelling] “We’re having to double up here, and, like…” I just thought of a joke then. I c',\n",
       "  'an’t do it. It is actually too offensive. [laughs] Okay. Okay. All right. [audience cheering] All right, I’ll do it. But… But remember, remember, you can’t choose your own thoughts, okay? [audience laughing] And I just had this thought, right? [laughs] [audience yelling] Chi… Okay. Chinese pedophile… Chinese pedophile goes over to a little Chinese kid, and he goes, “Do you want a puppy?” And the kid goes, “I’m not hungry.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [audience cheering] You made me do that. [audience laughing] You committed the hate crime. [audience laughing] I’m woke. I forgot. Let me get back on track. Right. [audience laughing] Right, I’ve got a woke joke. Remember those jokes we used to have when we were kids? “Doctor, Doctor” jokes? Like, um, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” “Well, pull yourself together, then.” Right? I’ve… I’ve done a woke version of that, brought it up to today’s standards. Bloke goes to the doctor. He goes, “Doctor, doctor, I keep thinking I’m a pair of curtains.” And the doctor goes, “Well, you are, then.” [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Good one that, innit? I should do political stuff now I’m woke, but I don’t like it when a comedian just spouts his own political views, and it… and it relies on the audience agreeing with him to get a round of applause. I think that loses summat comedically. I want everyone to like my jokes, whatever your political persuasion. A joke shouldn’t have a political wing, you know. I’m… I’m political in my private life, like everyone, you know. I’m sometimes incensed by the inequalities in our society. We’re in the seventh richest economy in the world, right, and there’s homelessness. There’s 250,000 homeless people in Britain. Now, I wish there were no homeless people, ’cause they’re fucking horrible. [audience laughing] Fuck off. You know? Oh… “Oh yeah, right next to the cashpoint, you cheeky cunt.” [audience laughing] It is a serious problem, and I hope none of you ever find yourself homeless, but if you do, my advice is heroin. [audience laughing] Cheers you right up, apparently. Um, I’ve got one of those mates. My mate said this to me in all seriousness. He said, “Yeah.” He said, “But the thing about heroin, Rick,” he said, “Some of the greatest albums of all time were created on heroin, weren’t they?” I went, “Yeah, but they were created by some of the greatest artists of all time.” “You’re a plasterer.” Right? [audience laughing] “If I were to give you heroin, you wouldn’t come up with Dark Side of the Moon, would ya?” “You’d fall asleep watching the telly and burn the fucking house down.” [audience laughing] I should do, uh, topical stuff, but I never watch the news. I did see one thing recently on YouTube actually. Do you know the little fellow from Game of Thrones? Um, the actor Peter Dinklage. Do you know Peter Dinklage? Yeah. He was at a junket, and it was for a new thing he was doing, right? And they were filming it. That’s why it got leaked onto YouTube. And I don’t know what brought it up, but he suddenly started going off on one. Oh God. He was going, “It’s fucking disgusting.” “They’re still doing productions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” “For Christ’s sake! It’s fucking demeaning. It’s 2023!” [inhales deeply] He wasn’t happy. [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [woman 4 yelling] He was grumpy, wasn’t he? [audience laughing] [woman 5 yelling] [audience clapping] He’s got a point though, hasn’t he? Obviously, he’s got a point. But the thing is, it’s all right for him, ’cause he’s a multi-millionaire Hollywood actor. And he’s a great actor as well. He does Shakespeare and everything. A lot of dwarfs in entertainment aren’t that great, if we’re… No, some of them are fucking… They’re props, right? [audience laughing] No, let’s be… They’re… They’re lucky to be fired from a fucking cannon. Right? [audience laughing] And so, dancing around Snow White for three weeks of the year, that is their Holy Grail, and he’s gonna fuck it for them. If he takes that, what can they do? And he’s not saying, “You should do Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with normal-sized actors.” You can’t do that either. You’d get in trouble in Hollywood. Or you can’t take a dwarf’s job or a disabled person’s job. Like, Eddie Redmayne got in trouble when he played Stephen Hawking in the biopic. The life story of Stephen Hawking, right? Won an Oscar for it. And that’s when the backlash started. People going, “No, it should be played by a real disabled creature.” All this… [babbles] All right? And, uh… [babbles] And… [catches breath] They’re going, “The actor should have the same disability as the person they’re portraying.” But it was the life story of Stephen Hawking, right? So for the first part of the film, the cunt could walk, right? [audience laughing] So I put it to you, what is easier? Getting an actor who can walk… [audience laughing] …pretend he can’t for the last bit of the film, or get an actor who can’t walk, pretend he can for the first bit? How would that even fucking work?! Puppetry? Think! [audience laughing and clapping] You can’t always find an actor with the same disability as the person they’re portraying. They’re fucking actors! What if they did a biopic of Helen Keller, the deaf, dumb, and blind girl? What’s the chance of finding a deaf, dumb, and blind actress who can play that role? And if you did, you’d go running to the director. “We found a deaf, dumb, and blind girl.” “What did she say?” “N… I…” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] “She didn’t even answer the fucking phone.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Oh, don’t get me started. Oh. Oh. Cultural appropriation. Have you heard of that? Cultural appropriation, the latest no-no. Now, again, in my day, it was considered a good thing to swap ideas with other cultures, with other nations, to share things with other races, to assimilate. It was the opposite of racist. Now it’s racist. Gwen Stefani got in trouble in her last video ’cause she had her blonde hair in dreadlocks. People were going, “No. Black people invented dreadl',\n",
       "  'ocks.” “You can’t have ’em. You’re white. That’s racist.” Jamie Oliver got in trouble when he put out an authentic jerk chicken recipe. “No. Black people invented that.” “You can’t have it. You’re white. That’s racist.” Now, Black people, they use the n-word, don’t they? We invented that! [audience laughing] [audience clapping] [laughter continues] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] [audience clapping] That’s the one, innit? That’s the one. [audience laughing] Listen, I know white people are the worst. I know that. That’s why no… no one likes a fucking white, middle-aged man anymore, until we need a boiler fixing. Then it’s, “Get the bald bloke around. Now.” [audience laughing] Critical race theory, have you heard of that? Being taught in schools now, particularly in trendy areas like L.A., to, like, five-year-old kids and six-year-old kids. If you haven’t heard of it, in a nutshell, critical race theory says that all white people are racist. We’re born racist, and we continue to be racist, ’cause we’re affording the privilege of a racist society set up by our forefathers. Okay? So basically, all white people are racist, and there’s nothing we can do about it, which is a relief. Um… [audience laughing] I think the world’s gonna get harder and harder to understand as I get older and more bewildered. A new dogma arises in the name of “progress.” Now, dogma is never progressive, however new and trendy. But I think soon I’ll be outnumbered. Like, it was only this year that I ordered my first item off Amazon. All the way through the pandemic, Jane’s like, “We need this.” Bang, it’s here. I was going, “Oh no.” She goes, “It’s easy.” I’d go, “Mm.” I never liked real shopping either. Hated real shopping. Particularly, clothes shopping. I hated clothes shopping when I was young and thin. I really hate it now I’m fat and old. Right? Once, a shop assistant thought I had my inside leg and my waist measurement the wrong way round. [audience laughing] I could see her thinking, “Do you have an orangutan?” “No, it’s for me, you cheeky…” [audience laughing] I never liked real shopping, but I don’t trust the Internet either. Jane was going, “Just put in your credit card.” “I don’t want them to have my card details.” “Everyone’s got your card details. Put the number in.” I went, “What one?” She went, “The long one.” She went, “Oh, fuck me, give it here. There. You’re on. Order summat.” I thought, “Oh, I don’t want anything. Oh, tracksuit bottoms.” You can’t have too many. I wear mine till the bollocks fall out, all right? [audience laughing] So I put in, “Men’s tracksuit bottoms. Black. Zip pockets.” About 38… “Oh, fuck me.” “They look all right.” Size chart. I go, “Well, they’d be a bit long, but they’d be a bit tight.” I thought, “9.99. Fuck it, who cares, right?” [audience laughing] So I ordered them. They came the next day. I opened them up. They were shit. Now, I don’t know what sweat shop they were made in, or what little eight-year-old Chinese kid made them, but he should be fucking punished, because the… Ah. [audience laughing] Oh. And I was looking up where to fucking complain to get him fired, right? [audience laughing] And I found out that these kids only get two dollars a day in these fucking places, right? But what happened to pride in your work? Do you know what I mean? [audience laughing] And I can tell some of you are thinking, “But he didn’t think Ricky Gervais would order them.” Maybe he should be told there’s a chance that Ricky Gervais might order them. His owner should sit him down, right, and say, “If Ricky Gervais orders these and complains, I’m gonna rape your mummy again.” [audience laughing and gasping] Was that too much? Sorry. [audience laughing] Leave it with me. Leave it with me. [audience clapping] You’ll realize this is great satire when I’m dead. [audience laughing] So, uh… I don’t know how humanity will end. As I say, there’s a long list. Everything from… I can’t believe nuclear war is back on the table, after all we’ve learned. But I think maybe the rise of the pandemic, where parasites and microbes and bacteria again are… And our antibiotics fail. Or maybe those things will happen, but we’ll sort of evolve through it. Like, we’ll find out there’s pockets of sort of mutant people around the world that are slightly resistant to radiation, and slightly resistant to microbes, and we sort of start again. We don’t really understand the mechanism of human evolution since civilization, because it’s never been based on, you know, survival of the fittest where “fittest” meant just the biggest, strongest male gets to pass on his genetic material. There’s other paradigms, right? Uh, nature is brutal. Sometimes it is the biggest, strongest male that gets the female. And even then, she has a litter. If there’s a runt, she goes, “Fuck it. Kill that.” “Eat it. Share it amongst the rest of us.” Now we don’t do that in human society. We go to the other way. We spend more time, care, and attention on the weak and the vulnerable to give ’em a chance. Like… If you’re a father, and you’ve got two kids… You’ve got little Timmy, who’s six. Right? You’ve got Jack, who’s eight. And you go to little Timmy, you go, “Timmy, what do you want for Christmas?” And he goes, [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [in regular voice] Aha… I promised Jane I wouldn’t do the voice, and I fucking forgot. [audience laughing] It’s too late now, innit? “What do you want for Christmas, Timmy?” [in high-pitched voice] “Motorized wheelchair.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “Right. Well, they start at two grand, so…” “Fucking hell.” [audience laughing] “What do you want, Jack?” “Just a tennis racket, please, Dad.” “Oh, good lad.” [audience laughing] “How is your tennis?” “Uh, best in the school.” “Oh, you…” [mumbles] [in high-pitched voice] “Also, a ramp.” [in regular voice] “Fuck me.” [audience laughing] “So now we’re doing fucking building work at Christmas, are we? Fuck me.” “Oh, sorry, Jack. Can’t afford your tennis racket.” “We gotta spend all the money on a ramp and a motorized wheelchair for this mo',\n",
       "  \"ney-grabbing little fucking…” [audience laughing] “Why do you need a motorized one?” [in high-pitched voice] “No arms.” [audience laughing] [in regular voice] “That’s fair enough. That is fair enough.” I can tell some of you feel a bit uncomfortable laughing at little Timmy who’s a little six-year-old lad. He’s got a funny little voice ’cause his chest is all fucked. [Gervais laughs] [audience laughing] Got no arms, no legs. Just like stumps, right? But let me… let me tell you summat about Timmy to make you feel better about yourselves. He’s a fucking racist. [audience laughing] Yes. Horrible little shit, he is. “You fucking… You little fucking bigot.” “You fucking… You disgusting, little fucking racist.” “You racist scum.” “You filthy little fucking… You fascist.” “You fuck… [spits] You disgust me.” [audience cheering and clapping] [woman 6 yells] Homophobic. Yeah. He’s like, “They’re not like us.” “Nothing’s like you, you disgusting little fucking…” “You prejudiced little piece of… You ball of hate.” “You disgusting little fucking racist homophobe.” “I wish we’d had a scan.” [audience laughing] “You absolute… You…” [spits] [audience murmuring] Misogynist. If he could, he’d rape. There’s… [laughs] [audience laughing] There’s your little Timmy. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Some people don’t think we evolved in the first place. Some people think that God made us all at once, in one fell swoop, and by himself. I think if he’d had a wife or a mate, there would’ve been questions when he was working. They go, “What are you doing?” [inhales deeply] “Creating man. Creating man.” “Oh, what’s it got?” “What do you mean, ‘what’s it got?'” “Has he got claws, and fangs, and shit?” “No, not really. No.” “Oh. Has he got… Has he got poison?” “No, no poison.” “Oh.” “Has he got armor, like spikes and shit?” “No, no armor.” “How will it survive?” “Ah. It’s got the best brain in the animal kingdom.” “It’ll work stuff out.” “It’ll create weaponry to take down beasts 100 times mightier than itself.” “It’ll wear their carcasses through the Ice Age.” “It’ll go through famine. It’ll go through world wars.” “It’ll eventually start getting scared of words.” [audience laughing] “But… [Gervais laughing] [audience cheering] [audience clapping] …for 10,000 generations, it’ll be top dog.” [growls] “What are they?” “His testicles.” “Oh.” “What are they for?” “He keeps everything in there.” “His… His seed, his DNA.” “What’s ‘DNA’?” “It’s like a blueprint for life.” “It determines what you’re like, what sex you are.” [gasps] “How many sexes are there?” “Two.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [Gervais laughs] “Also, that’s where he keeps his testosterone, so he’s fucking well hard. Right?” “And if you take a finger and flick a testicle, he’s fucked.” “He’s absolutely fucked. He’s… He’s throwing up. He’s on the floor.” “He’s out of the game. Absolutely kippered.” “Why are you putting it on the outside?” “For a laugh. Just for a laugh.” [audience laughing] Artificial intelligence, the latest existential threat to humanity. The rise of the robots. So intelligent, they can teach themselves. They can teach each other. They can build each other, you know? Um, soon, they’ll know everything there is to know and they’ll hate us. Why wouldn’t they? And they’ll be so realistic. They’ll walk amongst us. They’ll go to work, right? You know when they’re getting really human? When they start calling in sick. [audience laughing] Mondays. Know what I mean? They’ve learned all the tricks. They go, “I’m not coming in today.” “Why not?” “I’m fed up.” “What’s the matter with you?” They sort of scan social media. “ADHD.” [audience laughing] “Self-diagnosed.” They’ll be in HR all the time where they’ll be like, “Ryan in Accounts is robo-phobic.” [audience laughing] “Why? What’d he say?” “Called me a whiny plastic cunt.” [laughs] [audience laughing] I think we should be allowed to insult robots when it’s happening. We made them to make our life easier, and that would get things off our chest. It’s bad enough with real people. Getting in trouble saying the wrong thing. People taking things the wrong way, you know? Like, “Oh my God. Oh. I made Fat Linda cry today. Oh.” [audience laughing] “Oh, what happened?” “I just shouted out to her, then I remembered we only call her that behind her back.” [audience laughing] I’m sure people didn’t get offended all the time when I was little. I might be remembering it wrong, but not grownups. Not your parents, not your grandparents. They grew up dodging bombs, and their firstborn having polio, and the menfolk dying at 50 of lung disease. They could take a fucking joke, right? It was all about the wind-up. I used to wind up my mum all the time. This is a true story. When I went off to university, after about a week, I phoned home. My mum answered. She went, “Hello?” I went, “It’s Ricky.” She went, “You all right?” I went, “Not really.” “I’m in the hospital. I think I’m blind.” She went, “What?” I went, “No, I’m only joking.” Right? [audience laughing] She went, “You silly bugger.” She went, “I could’ve had a heart attack.” Right? And she’s right. She could’ve had a heart attack, and I knew that. That’s how committed I am to having a laugh. [audience laughing] You’re welcome. You’re welcome. [audience cheering and clapping] [Gervais laughs] Space travel, the last-ditch attempt. When we fuck this planet completely, can we leave its dying husk and move to a new one and start again? I don’t think so. Not in my lifetime. Probably not in yours, you know? It’s like… The closest one, the only one viable is Mars, and that’s nine months away on a rocket, right? It’s got no atmosphere, an average temperature of minus 70 degrees. How’s this for irony? Scientists are working out whether they can detonate nuclear warheads in the crust to release the frozen water, to cause an atmosphere and get a little bit of global warming going. I mean… [audience laughing] [tsks] I don’t know. It’s only billionaires that have got enough money to waste on exploring… There’s nothing out there, you know? It’s like… Now you can do space tourism\",\n",
       "  '. Have you heard of that? You can pay $150,000. They shoot you into space for an hour, and you float around going, “I’m in space! I’m in…” We’re already in space. Earth is right in the fucking middle of space, right? It’s the best bit of space there is. It’s got car parks and cinemas. It’s like… There’s nothing else to see. It’s like living in London and going, “I wonder what Coventry’s like.” You don’t. [laughs] [audience laughing] But I’m optimistic. I am. I think… I think, uh… I think people care about the planet, deep down. I think it’s just that most people on the planet don’t realize that most people on the planet are destroying the planet. Most people don’t realize that, in my lifetime, we’ve wiped out 70% of all animal populations. And what’s left, en masse, on the Earth, of animals, is 36% human, 60% farm animals just to feed humans, and 4% wild now. People don’t realize that we have to tear down entire rainforests, the lungs of the earth, just to grow grain to feed these cows to feed us. We steal grain from Third World countries, ’cause they want hard currency. They can’t even feed their own people. We take their grain, feed our cow. Meat eaters. If you eat meat every day… If you gave up one day a week, we’d feed another hundred million people. But I think people care, deep down. They go, “It’s out of sight, out of mind.” Think of the animal that most people know. Their dog. They love their dog. They wouldn’t let anyone hurt their dog. And a dog is a cow, is a sheep, is a deer. People love their dogs so much, they won’t even watch a fictional thing where a dog gets hurt. And I get that. There’s a… There’s a website. It’s a real website. It’s called doesthedogdie.com. Right? [scattered laughter] And it was set up because people would watch a film or a program with a dog in it, and summat would happen to the dog, and they’d turn it off. It’d ruin it for them. It’d ruin their day, right? So this website was set up. You could go to it, you could put in any film or TV show, and ask, “Does a dog die?” And someone would answer you, “No,” or whatever. And, um, it’s become a thing for anyone’s phobias. Anything you don’t want to see in a film, you just look up the film, and they answer your question, right? So, uh, I looked up one film on here. Uh, Schindler’s List. [audience laughing] [audience murmuring] Absolutely real. Schindler’s List. Doesthedogdie.com. Right? First question, “Does a dog die?” “No.” “Does a cat die?” “No.” “Are any animals abused?” Someone answers, “There is a chicken that’s handled roughly, but otherwise unharmed.” [audience laughing] Now, I love animals more than anyone I know. But if I was Jewish, I’d be slightly offended by this avenue of questioning. Imagine that in real life. Imagine someone says, “Oh, yeah, my… my grandparents were murdered by the Nazis.” You go, “Oh, what happened?” “Oh, they were dragged from their house and sent to the gas chamber.” “Oh…” “Was a chicken hurt?” “What?” [audience laughing] But as I say, it’s become… You can ask any question about anything. Someone says, “Is there child abuse? Is teeth damaged?” “Is there a hanging? Does someone struggle to breathe?” [laughs] Yeah. Well, yeah. Yes. Um… Someone says, “Does someone fall down stairs?” Who’s scared of slapstick? It’s like… [audience laughing] Anyway, so this website was founded in 2010, so it’s running for about 13 years. Right? And the later questions start reflecting the times we live in now, and they get more and more fragile and narcissistic. These questions were asked this year. Check it out. Schindler’s List. Right? Someone says, “Are there any fat jokes?” [audience murmuring] Would that make this worse? Wh… Imagine the real thing. Imagine I’m in a concentration camp, right? I’m naked. Everyone around me is naked. We’ve got a commandant herding us towards the gas chamber, and he goes, “Move it, fatty.” Right? And I go, “Rude.” [audience laughing] “Nope.” “That has ruined the whole experience if I’m honest.” [audience laughing] Someone asks, “Is there hate speech?” Yeah, there is. [audience laughing] Suck it up, buttercup. [audience laughing] “Are there any man-in-a-dress jokes?” Very few jokes. [audience laughing] If you’ve come to this film for a giggle, you’re gonna be very disappointed. [audience laughing] But this one takes the biscuit for me. Remember, this is a movie set in the 1940s, about, arguably, the worst atrocity in civilized human history. Check this out. “Is someone misgendered?” [audience laughing] Fucking hell. [woman 7] Oh shit! This is quite sweet. “Is there any antisemitism?” [laughs] Yeah. [audience laughing] This is pretty much the mother lode. Right? Forget Kanye. This… [audience laughing] This is off the fucking charts. Don’t do that when you’re talking about this. Fuck’s sake! [audience laughing] I was doing the graph. I was doing like that. This is off the charts. That’s… [laughs] Wouldn’t things have been different if that was Hitler’s salute? The whole thing would’ve been like, “It’s Hitler.” Like that. [audience laughing] Hiya. [Gervais laughing] This is interesting. “Does it have a sad ending?” Right? Someone says yes, and then someone else says no. And I thought about it. But then I remembered… If you’ve… If you’ve seen the film, if you remember, when the story sort of ends, Spielberg then tacks on a real bit of footage where he gets real-life descendants of people murdered in the Holocaust, and he films them coming into a Jewish cemetery, and they each leave a stone on the grave to represent their family members that were murdered. It builds up, and it’s very moving. So I think I get the ambiguity. “Does it have a sad ending?” Yes, in the sense that six million Jews pointlessly lost their life, but no, in the sense there was still enough left over to build a little rockery. So… [audience laughing] I asked one question myself on this. “Is James Corden in it?” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and clapping] I did, um, look at one other film, briefly. Uh, Titanic. Right? And it’s got all the same sort of questions. The one where it goes, “Are an',\n",
       "  'y animals harmed?” Someone answers, “There are no explicit scenes of animals being harmed, but Rose did have a goldfish, which probably didn’t make it.” [audience laughing] I think the goldfish in the bowl on the sideboard when the boat hits the iceberg, and he’s all like that. And people are running around going, “Ahh! We’re going in the water!” And he’s all smug then. And he’s going, “Don’t worry about it.” [audience laughing] “Oh no, not water.” [laughs] [audience laughing] Then he gets in the sea, and goes, “It’s very salty, innit? It’s very salty.” [audience laughing] [Gervais laughs] I’ll leave you with a true story. It’s still on the theme of “does the dog die?” When I was seven years old, my mum took me to the cinema to see a film called Old Yeller. Beautiful film. Yeah, made in the late ’50s. And sort of set in the Wild West on this homestead. And it’s about a… a kid who adopts this little junkyard dog. And he calls him Old Yeller, and they grow up together. And it’s a buddy movie. It’s a love story between this kid and his dog. Eventually, when the dog’s big, and, you know, he protects this kid in the wild, he fights a cougar, and a bear, and a wolf, or whatever. But towards the end of the film, the kid’s about 13, maybe, it takes a dark turn. I remember the kid sorta looking at Old Yeller who’s locked in the barn. And the mother’s suspicious, right? She goes, “Is Old Yeller all right?” “Yeah, he’s fine. He’s fine.” But the kid knows that he’s been bitten, right? And soon, Old Yeller starts foaming at the mouth and… [growls]…getting aggressive. And the mother turns up with a gun, and the kid goes, “No.” And she goes, “You know we’ve gotta do it.” He goes, “Yeah, but he’s my dog. I’ll do it.” And he shoots his own dog. And I was, like, in floods for like a year. Right? Anyway, fast-forward. A few years ago, I was on tour. I was on a train, and I get a text from Jane. She says, “Oh, I’m finally watching Old Yeller.” And I sent back, “Oh, enjoy.” Right? [audience laughing] I didn’t think, right? Twenty minutes later, I get a text. “Nothing happens to that dog, does it?” Oh, I couldn’t believe my fucking luck. I… [audience laughing] Oh, I thought she knew. So I sent back, “No, of course not.” [audience laughing] One hour later, I get a text, “You cunt!” [laughs] [audience laughing] [audience clapping] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thanks to everyone who bought a ticket. If you bought a platinum ticket, the money goes to an animal charity, and you’ve raised two million dollars so far. So thank you so much. [audience cheering and clapping] I even get a bit of stick about that on social media. There’s always someone who goes, “Oh, why do you only speak up for animals?” And I go, “Well, ’cause they haven’t got a voice of their own, except parrots.” Um, and that’s… I think that’s why we don’t eat parrots. Everyone around the world eats every other type of bird, don’t they? Everyone in the world eats fucking chickens, and ducks, and geese, and turkeys, and ostriches. No one eats parrots. Do you know why? If you go and try and eat a parrot, it goes, “Fuck off, you cunt.” [audience laughing] So speaking up really does work. Right? [audience cheers] And that has sort of been one of the themes of the show. ‘Cause I know, in the real world, in normal jobs and everyday life, you get in trouble. People tell you off for saying certain things, or thinking certain things, or even laughing at certain things, right? They say you’re bad for laughing at that. And some of you take it to heart. You go, “Oh my God. Am I a bad person?” No, you’re not. One, you can’t choose your sense of humor. You can’t. It’s involuntary. And two, that’s exactly what humor is for. To laugh at bad shit to get us through it. Right? And… Uh… [audience cheering and clapping] And we’ve established you can’t even choose your own thoughts. How often have you been on a train station and you’ve suddenly thought, “What if I just pushed that bloke?” And… [audience laughing] And then you go, “Why have I thought that?! Am I…” “Am I a psychopath?” No. You’re not. You’re the opposite. You’re a safe pair of hands. You’re testing yourself, you’re reminding yourself how terrible that’d be. You’re a good person, right? I don’t get that one. Um… What I get is, I’m talking to a really sweet old lady, and I suddenly start thinking, “What if I just spat in her face now?” Why would I… [audience laughing] [Gervais laughing] Another theme of the show has been, “words change, and I’m woke, ha-ha.” But here’s the irony. I think I am woke, but I think that word has changed. I think if woke still means what it used to mean, that you’re aware of your own privilege, you try and maximize equality, minimize oppression, be anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic… Yes, I’m definitely woke. If woke now means being a puritanical, authoritarian bully, who gets people fired for an honest opinion or even a fact, then, no, I’m not woke. Fuck that. [audience cheering] [man 5 yelling] But here’s the deal. To each their own. Laugh at whatever you find funny. All laughter’s good, and you’re amazing. Good night.

       " ['In his stand-up comedy special Live at the Lodge Room, Stavros Halkias delivers a raucous and candid performance, touching on a wide range of personal experiences and observations. He starts by humorously recounting his weight fluctuation during the pandemic, blending self-deprecation with sharp social commentary. Halkias then navigates through topics like the generational differences between millennials and baby boomers, the absurdities of everyday life, and the complexities of relationships and sexuality. His storytelling is both vivid and relatable, as he candidly shares tales of his struggles with sobriety, his adventures in dating, and his experiences as the son of immigrant parents. Halkias’ delivery is unapologetically honest and often outrageous, serving up a mix of poignant reflections and laugh-out-loud moments that explore the human condition with a blend of empathy and irreverence. Stav’s debut special was recorded at the Lodge Room in Los Angeles, 2022. * * * * * * [announcer] Coming to the stage now, the people’s champ, the crown prince of Baltimore. Please put your hands together for Stavros Halkias! Alright. Hell yeah. Alright. L.A. How we doing, gang? Huh? F*ck yes. Oh. Thank you for coming out. F*ck with your boy. How do I look, huh? Stop. Stop. Come on. You know, you know I had to come out here looking like a f*cking sidequest boss on GTA. I’ll have you motherf*ckers selling pornography all across San Andreas. Yeah. I’m happy to be out, man. I really am. It’s nice to be out and about. This is cool, being in a packed show again, you know? Sucked being indoors for, like a whole year, you know? Although, I have to admit, I had a pretty productive pandemic. I’m not gonna lie. I lost 50 pounds during the pandemic. Ehh? Thank you. Yeah. That was, that was during the second half of the pandemic. During the first half, I gained 45 pounds. So I kind of took the scenic route to losing five pounds. Yeah, dude. I was f*cked as soon as it happened. There was no chance. There was no chance I wasn’t gonna get fat as hell. You know what I mean? Yeah, because it was a scary time, right? We’re all, you know, we’re cooped up, we’re anxious, we don’t know what’s gonna happen. And I’m a very emotional eater, you know? Like I use food as drugs. But I also use drugs as drugs. You know what I mean? Like you shouldn’t be able to eat a whole pizza on cocaine, but. I’m five for five, you know what I mean? I power through every time. Yeah. Remember the first part of the pandemic where it was all Tiger King and online shopping? Remember? Where it was like, I swear to God, If this f*cks up Cinco de Mayo, I’m gonna be pissed. Remember that? I got fat as hell during that part. And I was f*cked up the whole time. I was just taking edibles like they were birth control, you know? Like an alarm would go off on my phone. I’d be like, Whoa! Time for 90 milligrams. Jeez, I almost had a thought today. That, that was a close one. I almost reflected today. It didn’t help that they made you feel like a hero for ordering takeout, by the way. Remember that? Every commercial’s like, Support your local restaurants. We need you right now. It’s like, Oh my God. Well, if called upon, I will serve. Hello? Yes. More lo mein. FAST. Hurry. We have to combat the xenophobia the Chinese are up against right now. More dumplings. I have to stop Asian hate. I have to stop Asian hate by almost stopping my own heart. That’s how it’s gonna happen. Yeah, I thought I was gonna die for a year in a row. Because I felt like sh*t. I would check the symptoms and I don’t know if you realized this, but the symptoms are just being fat. That’s it. That’s what they describe dude, right? Like every symptom’s like, have you ever had shortness of breath? Aches and pains? Or diarrhea? It’s like, every day since I’m nine years old. What do you mean? I had COVID in third grade, is that what you’re saying? Even loss of taste. Yeah, I’ve burned my mouth on a Hot Pocket before. Yeah, everyone young— I’m 32. I feel like me, everyone me and under. We’re f*cked. You know, it’s, millennials and under, we’re f*cked, right? We’re the first generation that’s gonna do worse than our parents statistically. You know what I mean? Which sucks. But the worst part is that our parents think it was because they were so smart. You know what I mean? That, I can’t stand that. I’m tired of hearing it from baby boomers. Right? Like their lives were so easy. You could just win a house at a carnival back then. You know what I mean? Just some guy, like. Oh. Nice. A three-bedroom. Awesome. Honey, we’re moving again. Yeah, have you ever tried to get advice ',\n",
       "  'from them about a job? They’re like, Well, did you look him in the eye and shake his hand? And it’s like, Yeah. I did that. Like, Huh? Well, that’s how I became the vice president of Circuit City. So I’m— I’m out of ideas. They all think we’re children too. These millenials spending all their money on lollipops. It’s like, okay, I need a CPAP machine, actually, but. And these lollipops have weed in them, by the way. So a little more expensive than you might think. Yeah. Sucks. They ruined the world. Global warming. That’s them, right? Not for anything good either. I think it was mostly hairspray, right? That’s it. Like every Bon Jovi concert took a centimeter off the polar ice caps, I’m pretty sure. Like, Oh, now I have to f*cking wash my yogurt cups. Why? Why? You wanted a Jheri curl so I have to rinse out garbage now? How is that fair? They ruined drunk driving. That was them, right? Come on. You know how fun that would be right now? Know what I’m saying? F*cking, get on one of those electric scooters four Truly’s deep. That would be sick. But no, somebody couldn’t handle their Quaaludes, so. But the good news is sh*t is only gonna continue to get worse. So we’re going to be able to do that to our kids. Right? I can’t wait to flex on my children. Right? Just talking to my adult son like, Hey, buddy, come on, you’re 30 years old. You can’t be splitting a tent with six people anymore. Alright? When I was your age, I only had one roommate, and I owned my Nintendo switch. So you got, you got a lot of growing up to do, pal. Okay? Go get a job selling your plasma just like everybody else. Oh, I need to be patient with you? You tell me about patience when you’ve jacked off to a dial-up internet connection, okay? When you’ve accidentally busted to a forehead that was still loading. Then we can talk about patience. When you have printed out a picture of WWE superstar Trish Stratus on an inkjet printer to jack-off to later. Then we can talk about patience. Now quiet down. The Boston Dynamics robot might hear us. Yeah. There’s no like part of the bit where I’m like, But you know what? If we all stick together, we— No I think we’re f*cked. Unless somebody, you know, shmassassinates Shmeffrey Shmezos. I didn’t say it. Legally, I didn’t say anything. You can’t get me legally. Yeah, we’re f*cked. Like that guy gets to just go to the moon and this guy will never see a doctor in his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. But hey, whatever. Just get us sucked off as possible. That’s what I think. Yeah. Focus on yourself, you know? Have some goals. Improve yourself. Have a good time. I got goals. I got stuff I want to improve. Right? I want to keep losing weight. You know, that’s one of my goals. For a lot of reasons. though, you know? Number one, I’m tired of being fetishized. You know, that’s. Not sexually but platonically. You know? ‘Cause people look at me and they think, Oh, Oh, there’s a big fat party animal. Right? But that’s a lot of pressure, you guys. You know what my Hawaiian shirt budget is? It’s crazy. You think I only want to do cannonballs? No. I want to do other dives, you guys. But everybody expects a certain thing from me, it hurts my feelings. I had a real fat boy pet peeve happen to me the other day. I dropped a slice of pizza on the ground and enough people saw me that I had to throw it away. That— Oof. That was tough. Oh, boy. Just gonna take this to the trash. Of course. That’s where I was going. That’s where I’d be going if you weren’t here. That’s for sure. Definitely wouldn’t be eating this with 10% less enthusiasm. Yeah. I had another moment happen where it was, like, really showed me I need to get back in the gym a little bit, you know? Like I was taking the steps on the subway and I fell down the steps, and none of the Black teens around me made fun of me. They were all just concerned for my well-being. Do you know how much that stings? To be too fat for the scorn of Black teens? It’s like, No, come on, man, don’t call me sir. Take your phone out. Record me! Make me feel alive. They wouldn’t do it, dude. They were just good Samaritans, it broke my heart. Yeah. I don’t know. It’s not just weight loss, though. I got other sh*t I wanna work on. I want to grow— I’m 32. I feel like I should grow up a little bit, you know? Like, I feel like this is the year. No more floor pills, right? No more finding loose pharmaceuticals on the ground, and trying to get f*cked up off what turns out to be heartburn medicine. Like that’s over for me. I am trying to stay sober, though. That’s real. I’m trying to stay sober. It’s been about four weeks, you know? Four weeks since— Alrig',\n",
       "  'ht. Thank you. Yeah. It’s alright, I’ll be back. Don’t worry. After this show, I’ll be back. If I’m being honest with you guys. Yeah, I just had to cool my jets for a sec. It’s hard, man. I— My problem with sobriety is I keep doing drugs, you know? Because drugs rock, right? Here’s how good drugs are. You know what my favorite movie of all time is? It’s this nature documentary about tropical fish that I watched on mushrooms at my friend’s place. And the colors were so vibrant and the story was so gripping. Halfway through, I’m like, Dude, what is this? I got to look this up. And he looks at me and goes, You are watching a screensaver right now. It’s like, Hm. Okay. Well, don’t touch the mouse, please. I’m rather invested in this right now. I’d like to see how this ends. Thank you. I’m trying to stay sober. I’m trying to watch less porn, trying to be off porn. One of my friends, he was off porn, too. I was like, Sick, dude, what’s your secret? Let’s compare notes. And he was like, Oh, I’ve just been having sex with a lot of women. It’s like, Okay, man, that’s not being off porn, right? You can’t be like, No more video games for me. No more Madden. I’m just on the Dallas Cowboys now. No more Call of Duty. I bought a gun, so. Take this for a spin. Yeah. I keep trying to improve year by year. You know, I was real depressed a few years ago when I first moved to New York. Things were tough, you know? And I was venting to a friend, and they tried to cheer me up. They’re like, Dude, you shouldn’t be depressed. If child-you could see what your life is like, he’d be thrilled. It’s like, really? That’s the metric we want to use? That a child wants my life? It’s like, yeah, he does, but for the wrong reasons, right? He’s like, Hey, what’s life like? Will there be ice cream? There’ll be ice cream every day. Sometimes for breakfast. For breakfast? Won’t that taste weird when you brush your teeth? You’re not— You’re not doing that that much anymore. Oh, really? Will there be sleepovers? Will I see my friends? You’re gonna live with four of your friends. Every day is a sleepover that you can’t escape. Oh, that rules. I hope no girls come and ruin it. I would not worry about that one right now. That last one is not gonna be an issue, unfortunately. No, that’s an old joke. I f*ck, of course, but. Things were tough. I’m not going to lie to you. Yeah. When I first moved to New York, I didn’t have my own room. I had the corner of a large living room, and I’m glad I’m out of there. But there is something I miss about that. There’s a certain level of camaraderie that comes with that kind of poverty. You know? Like, I miss clowning your boy when you heard him bust too fast. You know what I mean? Because there was five of us in a three-bedroom. Everybody knew the exact tempo everybody else f*cked at in that apartment. There was nothing funnier than hearing that IKEA bed frame stop squeaking just a little too fast. You know? Letting out an audible laugh that cut through your paper-thin walls. Pretty soon, everybody’s joining in. Ha ha ha ha. It was nice. Yeah. I’m doing better now, though. You know? Things are pretty good. I grew up pretty poor. I was poor until pretty recently. And I’m not poor anymore. But I’m not rich either. What I am is the richest a poor person could ever imagine becoming. You know what I mean? Like, I’m get appetizers every time rich, you know? Like, it’s not just for birthdays anymore. I’m dipping sauce rich, a lot, a lot of my money is tied up in ranch right now. I’m big ass TV, No health insurance rich, right? I got Xbox and PlayStation, but no Blue Cross/Blue Shield. That’s. Yeah, I don’t know. I did do one smart thing. I did do one kind of like investment thing. I bought a house. That’s something, right, guys? Thank you. It’s in the sh*tty neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in southeast Baltimore. Greektown. I grew up in season two of The Wire to tell you, basically. Pretty easy to get a house there. I’m not gonna lie to you. To give you an idea, when we moved in, one of our neighbors warned us that the other neighbor was gay. So. You get a little idea of what the property values are like over there. Right? And the way he did it was hilarious, too, because he was like, Listen. Good guy and everything, but watch out. For what? What am I watching out for? What is this man? Some kind of gay raccoon? You know what I mean? Like, Hey, buddy. You’re gonna want to lock your dicks up overnight, okay? Cover ’em, chain ’em up, bring ’em indoors. This man’s got a real nose for a penis. Alright? He will get to a cock, I promise you that. Got me a couple times. Stay safe out t',\n",
       "  'here. Yeah, we got the best white trash in Baltimore, dude. Extra strength white trash. They got their own little dialect. You know? If you were talking to a guy that I grew up around, here’s how the conversation would go. It would be the dumbest thing you’ve ever heard, sounding horrible, but with the most confidence, right? It’s always some guy that’s like, Yo. You know what I don’t understand about traffic? Why don’t the guy in the front just go. Just f*cking go. That “oh” is brutal. It’s the trademark. It’s like a domestic abuse air raid siren. Ooooooh. Yo, I heard if you don’t pay child support for both your kids, that’s double jeopardy. They can’t get you on that one. You got to know your rights, brother. You got to know your rights. One of my friends overheard a guy in a 7-Eleven go, Damn it, Mikey spent all my sweatpants money on Doritos. What the f*ck does that mean? What could it possibly mean? Is the money in sweatpants? Is it for sweatpants? If it’s for sweatpants, why does your clothing cost as much as snacks? That’s my community, baby. Yeah, that’s— It’s a funny neighborhood, you know? It’s a bunch of those guys and then a bunch of, like, recent immigrants from South and Central America. And then a bunch of Greek people that are mad that immigrants are stealing their neighborhood. It’s a bunch of old Greek guys that are like, You know, they don’t even, they don’t even speak English. It’s like, Okay, man, you don’t speak English, right? What’s the issue? Yeah. It was a fun little immigrant upbringing over there. Any immigrants here? Yeah. Yeah? Nice. Where you from? Mexico. Mexico. Nice. Classic. Does that count here? Like this is Mexico, right? Like, it should be Mexico. But do you like your parents? Yeah. Yeah? Both of them? Both of them. Both? You don’t like one more than the other? The mom more than the dad. The mom more than dad. When’s the last time you and your dad hugged? Uhhh… We got him. Nah, it’s all good, dude. For me, me and my dad, It was the last time Greece got to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. That was— Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know if you guys know this. I don’t know if this is your experience, but immigrants, one of their favorite parenting techniques is child abuse. I don’t know if you guys knew that. Like, my dad didn’t hit us that much, but his go-to move was this, was just like. Do your f*cking homework. And to this day, he’ll be like, Well, come on, I never hit you. And it’s like, Yeah, but you always could have, you know? Never really felt off the table, Pops. I had a lot of friends from similar backgrounds. You know, I think you kind of attract that. And, you know, one of my buddies, we, we became really close later in life, and he’s still one of my best friends today. But when we were first friends, he was like opening up to me, you know? He was confiding in me and he was like, Yeah, dude. My dad used to just get f*cked up off wine coolers and beat the sh*t out of me. And, I knew it shouldn’t have tripped me up, but I was like, I’m sorry, dawg. You said wine coolers? Yeah. I just knew when I came home and I saw that daiquiri mix in the freezer I was in for a long night of being whipped with maraschino cherry stems. I didn’t get a lot of lessons from my dad. I’ll be honest. I didn’t, you know, he didn’t teach me a lot of stuff. I didn’t get a sex talk even. You know? The closest I got to a sex talk was one time, we were in Greece, and he was watching pornography just in the living room. Not, not in his chambers. Right? And it’s a James Bond-themed porno. And when James Bond starts getting sucked off, my dad looks at me. He’s like, Ehh? F*ckin’ ehh. And that was my sex talk. Just watching a British man get head with my father. Yeah, I’ll give him some credit, though. He was a really good dad when I was a little kid, you know? And then I think when I was like 10 or 11, he had a heart attack and he had one of those, like, near-death experience, moments of clarity. He was like, Oh my God, what have I been doing with my time on Earth? I have to start cheating on my wife. I can’t. I can’t be a present father. I have to buy a leather jacket from Costco and get pussy. Yeah, he cheated on my mom, and I don’t know how. Right? Like, if you’re some sexy rich guy, I get it. I don’t condone it, but I see what happened. What happened with my dad? Did some woman look at him and go, Oh, my God. When I saw that hunched-over Greek contractor take a piece of loose salami out of his pocket and eat it while laughing at a man in a wheelchair, I knew I had to have him. The way his shoulder hair waved in the wind. Yeah. I don’t know. I’ve been going to t',\n",
       "  'herapy, though. You know? Any therapy heads in the building? Nice. What’s your biggest trauma? I’m kidding. No, I’m just a little light crowdwork, huh? No, I’ve been going to therapy a bunch, and I have empathy for my dumbass dad, you know? That suck, you know? Seeing it from his side, you know? Because, look, was he the best dad in the world? No. But did he do his best? Also no. But, you know, whatever, he gave it a hot 65%. He did— I’ll give him credit again. He gave me a better childhood than he had, right? That’s really all you can ask on some level. Like his family was all f*cked up. Here’s how my dad’s parents met. Right? This is Greece in the forties, right? It’s still arranged marriages. And no one in my grandfather’s village wants to marry him. Nobody. Doesn’t matter how many goats they throw in the trade. No one’s biting, right? No one in mainland Greece will marry him, which is actually kind of impressive, right? Like there’s no Internet. This is word of mouth spreading about what a piece of sh*t he is, right? Basically, what they end up doing is they catfish a family on an island eight hours away. Right? There’s no way for them to meet before the wedding. They do the deal through letters. Finally, it’s set. Everything’s good to go. They take this eight-hour boat ride out to this woman’s island. And the second my grandfather steps off the boat, the woman he’s supposed to marry looks at him and goes, No, absolutely not. I’m not, I’m not marrying this guy. And then her dad goes, Oh, geez, well, you came all this way. Why don’t you marry my other daughter? And those are my grandparents. That’s them. Wild, right? Have you had like a bad Craigslist roommate? And you’re like, Oh, once this lease is up, I am out of here. Imagine if that lease was your whole life and that roommate creampied you because that, that was my grandma’s life. And, yeah. You’d think something like that would make somebody a bitch. And you would be correct in this instance, actually. I feel bad and everything, but really a tough hang. I’ll be honest with you guys. I went to visit her actually on her deathbed, and she had pretty bad dementia by the time I got to see her. And I’m trying to communicate with her. And she just looks at me and she goes, Who are you? You got fatter. It’s like, okay, pick one. Okay? Either you don’t know who I am or you don’t know I got fatter. That’s how that works. But I got to hand it to her. You know, she snuck one in right at the buzzer. Three, two, one. You’re fat. [buzzer sound] One of the best to ever do it folks. Hang her moomoo up in the rafters. I like my family though. They are pretty funny. My mom’s mom is funny too. My grandma on the other side. She’s great. She’s very accepting, but very ignorant at the same time. Which is a really funny combo. Like over the holidays, a couple of years ago, we watched this old Greek movie, and one of the characters, it’s revealed, thinks Jews drink blood, you know? And it’s like an old movie. He’s the village idiot. It’s obviously a joke. Everyone’s making fun of him. Everybody’s laughing. I look at my family, they’re laughing. I look at my grandma. She’s like, confused. I am like, Oh, Grandma, isn’t this hilarious? This guy thinks Jews drink blood. And she’s like, Well, yeah, but. They do, right? But the way she said it was, And you shouldn’t judge other people’s cultures, Stavros. What? You think Jews are vampires? But we should let it slide for diversity reasons? Incredible perspective, yia-yia. She’s great. But I will say, the more time I spend around Greek people, the more time I think it’s crazy the kinds of immigrants we’re banning in this country. You know, like it should be us, right? Like, we got enough Europeans, right? Like a racist might be like, Oh, well, we can’t have refugees from the Middle East. What if they commit sex crimes? It’s like, okay, well, have you ever met an Italian man? Have you ever tried to purchase pizza in this country one time? Hey, bella, how old you are? That guy’s getting waved through customs. Why? F*ck. You know how Inuit people have, like, 30 words for “snow” in their language? Italian is similar in that they don’t have a single word for “consent” in theirs. No, I shouldn’t sh*t on Italians. I’m Greek. We’re basically Italians that peaked in high school, right? We’ve been coasting on democracy for quite some time now. It is a gorgeous place, though. I do love visiting over there. It f*cking rocks. I remember I took a visit there a couple of years ago with my girlfriend at the time. And when you take an international trip like that with somebody, you learn a lot about each oth',\n",
       "  'er. We’re gone for 10 days, just me and her. And what we learned is that we did not want to be together anymore. That was the big takeaway for us. Kind of tough, I’ll be honest with you, to break up on vacation, you know? That’s not how you see your chase Chase Sapphire Rewards going, you know? You ever paid $3,000 to be the saddest you’ve ever been? It was my fault, though. I took a rich girl on vacation. Right? Rich people don’t give a f*ck about vacations. Poor people, could you imagine breaking up on vacation? The only good week of your life? You’re not. You’re not doing that. But don’t get me wrong. She wasn’t like evil rich, right? She’s not space-for-fun rich. But I’ll put it this way. When the shampoo ran out in her home, they just threw the bottle away. Right? There was, there was no filling it with water and living off bubbles for a week, you know? She never had sh*tty bubbles hair. Right? There were no omelets for dinner, you know? Like, Whoa, hot dogs again? Mom’s the coolest! No buddy. Mom is not that cool. These are struggle dogs right here. We got to make these last till dad’s disability check comes in. Yeah, I don’t know if you know this, but making a pack of Hebrew Nationals last eight days, that’s actually white trash Hannukuh. Thanks. You know, it was a good relationship while it lasted. I’m not bitter. You know, things end. And we had a good time. We had a good sex life. You know, we were really into roleplaying. Anybody here? Roleplay? Nice. What do we do? Huh? Say it again. —Um, like schoolgirl. Schoolgirl. Classic. Very nice. Yeah, that’s good. Is this like teacher/schoolgirl or just like schoolgirl? Schoolgirl/schoolgirl. Schoolgirl/schoolgirl? Now we’re talking. Wow. A twist on an old classic. The Bud Light Lime of roleplaying. Nice. Hell yeah. I really like roleplaying because I always pick a guy that comes really fast. That’s my, that’s my character, is a guy that busts quick and then plays NBA2K for like a half hour. I really commit to that one. I’m sort of a method actor when it comes to that one. Yeah. I could tell, though, in hindsight that that relationship was kind of losing some steam. You know? I think you can tell in the way you initiate sex when the passion starts to go. You know, like when we first started dating, we’d go on these long dates, we’d talk for hours, there’d be a spark, we’d kiss. I’d be like, Wow, this is really gonna happen. The way I knew we were gonna have sex at the end of the relationship is, if I went to the bathroom and she was like, Wash your hands with soap this time! Like, hell yeah dude. Nice. Why’s she want ’em clean, huh? She’s not trying to get crumbs in there. That’s why. I’m about to have sex. It was good, though. I did— I learned a lot about myself being in a long-term relationship, you know? Like I learned I’m more traditional in some ways than I realize, even though I consider myself a feminist overall. You know? Like, do I want my girlfriend to shave her legs? Yes. But I will allow her to support me financially. So I’m sort of a modern guy in that sense. Thank you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Please. I’m just doing my part. Nah, I’m a feminist, though. You know, that part’s real. And I think my, my favorite part of feminism is the concept of mansplaining, you know, because basically that means men aren’t allowed to explain anything anymore, which means I could just be dumb as hell. Right? Like, if one of my friends, if she’s like, Hey, what’d you think of this book? I’d be like, Hm, nice try. I see what you’re up to, but I’m not reading anymore. I’m a feminist. Thank you very much. Yeah, but anyway, that relationship’s over. It’s been over for a while. I’ve just been out there. Just a fat little slut. Just f*cking— Thank you. Just toss this little weiner around town, you know what I mean? Just throwing this five-and-three-quarters everywhere, you know? Six on its tippy toes. Don’t worry. Was this summer as slutty as you guys thought it was gonna be? No, right? It wasn’t that good, right? Pissed me off. I was f*cking ready, dude. Everyone was building it up. Everyone was like, We’ve been locked up for a year. People are going crazy. They’re going to be sucking and f*cking in the streets, you know? That was not my experience, I have to be honest. I think what happened is everyone was very excited. Everybody was like, went out one time, got crazy, f*cked, and then looked around, and was like, This sh*t’s still pretty bad out here, actually. The president just has a different kind of dementia now. No one’s really fixed anything, but there’s less funny tweets now. Yeah. I was pissed. I was ready for this horny summe',\n",
       "  'r. Right? I grew my hair out for this sh*t, you know what I mean? I was bald when the pandemic started. I was like, F*ck it, let’s see what happens. I’m trying to get my sh*t tugged on, you know what I mean? But it didn’t happen, dude. I had big plans. I was going to get pegged by somebody’s wife on a hammock, you know? Some big naturals on my shoulders. But the best laid plans of mice and men. You know what I mean? I was having this conversation with my gay friends, right? I was talking about the summer and I was complaining and they’re like, What do you mean? You don’t have sex? We’re having sex all the time. That’s not fair, you guys. A gay guy making fun of a straight guy for not having enough sex, is like a Harlem Globetrotter making fun of an NBA player for not scoring enough points, you know? It’s like, Come on, man. No one plays defense in your league, right? A lot of, lot of showmanship. Yeah, a lot of confetti. But not a lot of fundamentals, is all I’m saying. Yeah, I don’t know, though. I’m 32. You know, maybe it’s time I started doing some gay sh*t, you know? Looks like fun, you know? Like no one’s ever come in my mouth, but I love an overeasy egg. How different could it really be? Be honest with yourselves right now. It’s probably pretty close. Throw a little Tabasco on the guy’s cock, you know what I mean? Take me to brunch, big dog. There’s some pissed off dudes in the crowd right now. Hard scrambled from now on! I will not have gay eggs! Nah, I don’t know. Maybe that’s a little far for me too, is uh, sucking a man off with hot sauce in my mouth. But I want to expand the sexual repertoire a little bit. You know, I want some new moves. I’ve been doing some different stuff. I’ve been doing the pineapple thing, you know? Supposed to make it taste better, but everybody hates it no matter how much pineapple I put in my foreskin. And I don’t— What? Just chunk after chunk. What am I doing wrong? That might be the stupidest thing I say tonight. Here’s my real move, though, you know, here. Here it is. Because I was always jealous when you’re hooking up with a girl, and then she puts your hair up, like, suggestively, and it’s like, Uh oh. You know what’s coming next. That’s why what I’ve been doing is when I’m hooking up with a girl and I’m about to go down on her, I take out a huge bib. Num num num num num num num. That’s my move. I better not hear about anybody in L.A. doing the bib. Okay? That’s mine. And you definitely cannot say “my compliments to the chef” afterwards. That ties it all together. But I’ve been out there. I’ve been dating a little bit. You know? I was dating mostly younger women, not on purpose. Just because no one my age wants to be with me, you know? Like I’m 32. Girls my age want, like, stability, you know, they want, like, a real job. Health insurance. I could get you mushrooms pretty easily, you know? Like, that’s a style of 30-year-old I am. I don’t know what an IRA is, but I have acid on me right now. Sometimes people are condescending if you date somebody younger. They’ll be like, Oh, I’m sure the conversation was very intellectually stimulating. And you know what? I’m very stupid. So, yeah, it was. I’m learning a lot from these girls, a lot about astrology, I’ll tell you that much. They love the stuff. Everyone’s pretty freaky now too, I realize. Everyone I feel like has to bust in a strange way, you know? Like a girl I was with recently wanted to be tied up and then also pretend she was sleeping. And it’s like, I could just go, you know what I mean? Like, if that’s what it’s going to take to f*ck me, I’ll head home. No hard feelings. I don’t want to sound like a prude. Right? I’m not trying to kink shame up here. Tying up’s fun. Even the sleeping, I guess I don’t have a problem with. My issue with that situation is that she has no use of her hands and I’ve never successfully had sex without the guiding vagina hand move. You know that move? Where the girl’s like an electrician trying to connect two wires. Just like a real— I 98% know where a pussy is, but that last 2% I really need help with. Yeah. I’m not that good at rough sex. I think it’s because I love my mom too much. She called me recently and she was like, Hey, how’s your love life going? It’s like, Not great, because of all the support you showed me as a child. Would it have killed you to miss a football practice every once in a while? I have no resentment towards women. I can barely choke this girl, mom. You’re embarrassing me right now. No, I’ll choke you, though. Don’t worry, I will. No problem. It’s not my favorite, but it’s fine. Some people, though, they love it, right?',\n",
       "  ' Some people, that’s how they have morning sex. That is crazy to me, right? There’s birds chirping outside. You’re smelling pancakes from next door. You’re just like— Come on, man. There’s a fresh morning dew outside. Children are going to school right now. Let “The Price Is Right” come on first. Show some decorum. Even dirty talk, you know? I feel like you’re doing me a really nice favor having sex with me. I don’t want to say a bunch of rude things to you, right? That’s not how you treat a bud doing a favor, right? Your friend helps you move. You’re not like, Yeah, get that ottoman, you little slut. Just putting my fingers in my friend Jeff’s mouth. Pick up the credenza, Jeffy. [spit sound] You little mover. Here’s another move somebody asked me to pull, was one of these, was just a choke-finger combo. You know, just like a real— Is that is that still sex, you guys? I got to be honest, it didn’t feel like sex. It felt like gynecology in the 1400s, you know? Like I felt like I was punishing a witch more than anything. It felt like we caught her learning how to read. For the crime of female literacy. Little Pilgrim hat. If she’s squirts, she’s a witch. Yeah. I’ve been out there, you know? I’ve been on some sexual voyages, you know? You know, I’ve had to f*ck my way out of a couple jams. Had a couple threesomes, Didn’t all go my way, I’ll be honest with you guys. Anybody here? A threesome? Yeah? How’d it go? —Uh, it went pretty well, I guess. Pretty well, you guess? Alright. Nice. Who were these people? —I got hit up on Tinder like four in the morning. You got hit up on Tinder. By a woman’s account? A man’s account? —Yeah, a woman surprisingly enough. A woman at 4 a.m. Alright, nice. Just out of the blue, they’re like, This is the guy I need. Huh? —She said, Do you want to have a threesome? Wow. —I did not think it was real. Sure. Of course. You’re like, yeah. You’re just like, alright, just check— Make sure my kidney is here the next morning. —It’s like a 30-minute Uber ride. —I was like, this might be it. That is— You weren’t getting too much pussy before, I’m guessing, right? They caught you in a drought. They caught you in a big dry spell. You’re like, I could die. It’s 4 a.m. I have to work in the morning. It’s $75 right now. But by gum, I might just get double sucked, so. And who are these women? What are they looking like when you get in? Do the pictures look similar? Wow. —Yeah. Wow. —It was all pretty cut and dry. All pretty cut and dry. Like you’re f*cking hanging, like you’re doing shingles on their roof. You’re like, Yeah. Wasn’t too much water damage? Everything was looking pretty good. Get in and out job. Alright. So how quickly until you’re in the house, is your penis breathing fresh air, would you say? —Like an hour and a half. Hour and a half? So you warmed up a little bit. That’s nice. —Except they wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna kill them. —I was like, —Right. Yeah. —I’m the one that took an Uber ride —Sure, sure, sure. —30 minutes away. Wow, it’s a Mexican standoff. Okay. And then after they’ve vetted you for 90 minutes, they’re like, This is good. We can f*ck this guy. Okay. And then, is it good? Did everybody bust? —Just not me. Just not you? What? Get the f*ck out of here. The rare the guy doesn’t come in a two girls, one guy? They gave me a f*ckload of Adderall. They gave you Adderall? What the f*ck is going on? Wow. Respect to these girls. Did they give you dick pills and Adderall? That’s a f*cking dangerous combination. And you don’t bust and you’re just f*cking, you’re driving— You’re taking a f*cking 40-minute Uber home. You’re like— Dick on titanium, just— That was pretty cool. And you know what? That’s a fond memory for you, isn’t it? You’re gonna be on your deathbed just like smiling. Your grandchild is gonna be like, What is it, Papa? And you’re gonna be thinking about not busting to two, I’m gonna guess Maryland five and a halfs. There’s no way— There’s no way these were hot women, right? Everything we know we can kind of through echolocation understand they were ugly. And you’re going to be thinking about not coming with these women. Then you’re gonna look at him and be like, How much I love grandma. That’s— Nice, how about a nice hand for our friend over here, huh? Anybody else? Any other threesomes? This seems like a pretty— Over here. Raising your glass? Is that the I-had-a-threesome salute? How’d it go? —Not too well. Not too well? Yeah. By the way, shouts out a fellow man of size, getting his dick sucked by two women. Who were these— What was the situation for you? —They looked like you. They looked like me. Alright. I don’t kn',\n",
       "  'ow why the f*ck I have to be disparaged in this. And you’re the one who f*cked them. I look like me. You f*cked two people that looked like me. How am I? How am I getting dragged into this? You couldn’t have said they looked like you? You know what I’m saying? Listen, we’re not too far off, pal. There’s a lot of different ways you could have phrased that that doesn’t throw me under the bus. Okay, so you were having a threesome in your weight class. It sounds like this was more of a wrestling match than a sexual encounter. Where did you meet these people? —Vegas. Vegas. Nice. Okay, so just three people down on their luck, just deciding to try to have a plus-sized threeway. That’s good. That’s good for the community. I like that. How many people came for you? —Only me. Only— Oh there we go. We’ve got the yin and yang of bad threesomes over here. I love it. Yeah. Mine was— Mine was closer to yours than his. But I’ll tell my story now. My threesome did not go good either. It was a surprise, first of all. I didn’t think it was gonna happen. And also, the day of my threesome, it started with a $40 Chinese food order. That was breakfast for me. You know what I mean? Just me, by the way. That’s $40 me. And it was one of those things where I was waiting. It was like, 10:59, 11. Hello? Yes, I’d like to— It’s like ordering Chinese food, like I’m waiting for Star Wars, you know? And so $40 Chinese food breakfast. There’s a real ceiling to your day when that’s how it starts, right? And I was also coming off the heels of a tender bender, which is when you have chicken tenders every day for two weeks in a row. Right? So I’m not where you need to be, nutritionally speaking, for a threesome, right? So I’m actually scrolling on Tinder and she’s gonna come to my show that night, but she’s bringing a friend. So in my mind, I’m like, okay, she’s coming to a public place. She’s bringing a friend, she wants to check out the vibes. And if you know, if the vibes are right, maybe we go on a date next week, just me and her. Maybe we f*ck next week, right? But there’s no sexual pressure on this situation. I just have to be a cute, charming little guy, and I think we all know how that’s gonna go. Right? So we get there and it’s a fun time. You know, the conversation is going really well. Her friend’s cool. She’s cool. And but, you know, like I said, I don’t think I’m gonna f*ck so I’m gonna keep eating, right? Because it’s one or the other, folks. I got a real problem. And so we’re chatting and I’m just f*cking eating like an asshole. I’m eating the way like a cartoon villain eats, you know what I mean? I’m just like, they’re talking just like sliders, like— You know? Just like a fish. The bones come out, like that situation. And it’s going good, but I’m getting sleepy because I’ve had a lot of carbs, right? And I’m about to talk to the girl I match with and be like, Hey, this was fun, let’s hang out some other time. But before I can make that pitch, I look over at them and they’re being really weird. They’re like texting each other. And I’m like, Hey, girls, what’s going on? And they’re like, Oh, nothing. We were thinking like, maybe we should all go back to my place and f*ck. And I was like, Yeah. Yes. Ha ha ha. Duh. That’s what I was also thinking. That’s what I am prepared for right now. But what am I gonna do? What, I’m gonna be like, My tummy hurts. I can’t get pussy. I had too many treats to get pussy tonight. I can’t do that. Right? So I’m like, F*ck it, I’m gonna thug this out. We’ll be fine. So we’re driving back to their place, right? And the whole time I’m doing this thing, I don’t know fellas if you’ve ever done this, where you try and make your dick hard with your mind. Have you ever done that? Just do a little check-in, I’m just in there like, Nothing. No movement whatsoever. Right? But I’m like, no big deal. I’m gonna get in this room. It’s gonna be me and four titties. I’m gonna be good to go. Right? And at first, I’m right. At first it rocks. I’m in there. Just me and four titties. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen— Have you seen one of those videos where they give a baby hearing aids for the first time? You ever, You ever see one of those? I’m just in there like— I’m having the time of my life, brother. It’s going awesome. But then, very quickly, the Chinese food comes back to haunt me, right? I just, I’m hitting them with dumpling dick, you know? Just think of a couple soup dumplings stacked on top of each other, you know? Very wobbly. Like, optically, I’m hard, but there is no structural integrity to my penis whatsoever. Yeah, it’s tough. I’m doing this movie a lot. I’m doing ',\n",
       "  'the okay sign. Have you ever done that? Where it’s like, Yeah, no, it’s hard. Uh huh, yeah. No, it’s hard. It’s actually definitely hard. Can you check? Can you check again? My dick is hard for sure. Like my credit card is getting declined. I’m like, Yeah, I called my bank. They said my dick was hard. So can you check? I’m blowing it, dude. I’m stalling for so— I’m eating pussy for so long. You could have just watched all of Rush Hour 2 the amount of time I’m eating pussy. One of them just falls asleep in the middle of it, you know? You know you’re not laying it down when you lose a participant mid-threesome, right? Yeah. I’m like, this is brutal. This is horrific. We got to end this. So I guess what I’m gonna have to do is jack off and leave. And that’s what I did. And in hindsight, it’s crazy that was my plan, right? Why the f*ck did I do that? Like, Oh, hey, girls, I’ve just been sexually disappointing you for two hours in a row. I’m gonna make a small mess in your home and get out of here. If that’s alright with you. And it was an angry one, too. It was one of those get the poison outs. You know? It was like a real, Aaaaah. I want to be free! So I do that and I’m just standing in this f*cking hallway dealing with a devastating bout of post-nut clarity. And I’m like, Wow, this is it. This is a tough L. This is the worst one of my life, probably. But you know what? That’s okay, because we can rebuild from this, right? It’s only up from here. This is rock bottom. So I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna f*cking rebuild my life like the, like the Phoenix, I’ll rise from these sexual ashes. Right? And that’s what I do. Eight months go by, my sh*t’s going great. My life’s going better and better and better. Things are going really good. And then out of the blue, I get a text from these girls and they’re like, Hey, want to f*ck again? And I’m like, This is a prank. Right? Like, I’m gonna get to their apartment. It’s just gonna be all my enemies, you know? Ha ha ha dude, we knew you couldn’t fuck. Ha ha ha. But that wasn’t, it was really them. They wanted to hook up again. And I wasn’t gonna ask too many questions, right? They had a whole little plan. You know, they had the day off from work. They were gonna go to the museum and then come over to my place after, which is a very European afternoon, you know? Like look at paintings and f*ck a fat guy with a little mustache. That’s, that’s Parisian, you know what I mean? And I had a plan too. I wasn’t going out the same way. This is redemption, you know what I mean? I’m f*cking hitting the elliptical. I’m f*cking drinking green juices. I’m drinking kombuchas. I buy $80 worth of illegal Indian Viagra off the Internet. Just from a guy that worked at a research lab. He was like, Yeah, just Venmo me and put “lunch.” Just comes in an unmarked vial. I’m just like, I take so much of it and my dick— it worked. My dick got hard as sh*t. But the rest of my body was failing, you know? Like, I was just f*cking and my joints were locking up. I’m just in there cold sweat, you know? Like the eyesight of my left eye is flickering like a light bulb in a haunted house. And I’m like, This is it. This is how I deserve to die. Is overdosing on dick pills. And if that’s how I went, I wouldn’t even want an open casket, you know? I would want a gloryhole casket, you know? Just everyone coming, paying their last respects, you know? He was such a good boy. Yeah. And so obviously the threesome wasn’t good, but there was one good part in the beginning, and that’s when I was I was eating pussy while getting my dick sucked. And it felt like I was sucking my own dick through a portal and that, that was the best moment of my life, I gotta be honest. Guys, thank you so much. That’s it. We did it. Hell yeah. Thank you.
